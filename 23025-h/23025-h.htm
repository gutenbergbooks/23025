<h3>THE AMERICAN BUSINESS MAN</h3>

<p>The business man is the national hero of
America, as native to the soil and as typical of
the country as baseball or Broadway or big advertising.
He is an interesting figure, picturesque
and not unlovable, not so dashing perhaps
as a knight in armor or a soldier in uniform, but
he is not without the noble (and ignoble) qualities
which have characterized the tribe of man
since the world began. America, in common
with other countries, has had distinguished
statesmen and soldiers, authors and artists&mdash;and
they have not all gone to their graves unhonored
and unsung&mdash;but the hero story which belongs
to her and to no one else is the story of the
business man.</p>

<p>Nearly always it has had its beginning in humble
surroundings, with a little boy born in a log<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
cabin in the woods, in a wretched shanty at the
edge of a field, in a crowded tenement section or
in the slums of a foreign city, who studied and
worked by daylight and firelight while he made
his living blacking boots or selling papers until
he found the trail by which he could climb to
what we are pleased to call success. Measured
by the standards of Greece and Rome or the
Middle Ages, when practically the only form of
achievement worth mentioning was fighting to
kill, his career has not been a romantic one. It
has had to do not with dragons and banners and
trumpets, but with stockyards and oil fields, with
railroads, sewer systems, heat, light, and water
plants, telephones, cotton, corn, ten-cent stores
and&mdash;we might as well make a clean breast of it&mdash;chewing
gum.</p>

<p>We have no desire to crown the business man
with a halo, though judging from their magazines
and from the stories which they write of
their own lives, they are almost without spot or
blemish. Most of them seem not even to have
had faults to overcome. They were born perfect.
Now the truth is that the methods of accomplishment
which the American business man
has used have not always been above reproach
and still are not. At the same time it would not
be hard to prove that he&mdash;and here we are speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>ing
of the average&mdash;with all his faults and failings
(and they are many), with all his virtues
(and he is not without them), is superior in character
to the business men of other times in other
countries. This without boasting. It would be
a great pity if he were not.</p>

<p>Without trying to settle the question as to
whether he is good or bad (and he really can be
pigeon-holed no better than any one else) we
have to accept this: He is the biggest factor in
the American commonwealth to-day. It follows
then, naturally, that what he thinks and feels
will color and probably dominate the ideas and
the ideals of the rest of the country. Numbers
of our magazines&mdash;and they are as good an index
as we have to the feeling of the general public&mdash;are
given over completely to the service or
the entertainment of business men (the T. B.
M.) and an astonishing amount of space is devoted
to them in most of the others.</p>

<p>It may be, and as a matter of fact constantly
is, debated whether all this is good for the country
or not. We shall not go into that. It has
certainly been good for business, and in considering
the men who have developed our industries
we have to take them, and maybe it is just as
well, as they are and not as we think they ought
to be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a time when the farmer was the
principal citizen. And the politician ingratiated
himself with the people by declaring that
he too had split rails and followed the plow,
had harvested grain and had suffered from wet
spells and dry spells, low prices, dull seasons,
hunger and hardship. This is still a pretty sure
way to win out, but there are others. If he can
refer feelingly to the days when he worked and
sweated in a coal mine, in a printing shop, a cotton,
wool, or silk mill, steel or motor plant, he
can hold his own with the ex-farmer's boy. We
have become a nation of business men. Even
the &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; farmer has become a business man&mdash;he
has learned that he not only has to produce, he
must find a market for his product.</p>

<p>In comparing the business man of the present
with the business man of the past we must remember
that he is living in a more difficult world.
Life was comparatively simple when men
dressed in skins and ate roots and had their
homes in scattered caves. They felt no need for
a code of conduct because they felt no need for
one another. They depended not on humanity
but on nature, and perhaps human brotherhood
would never have come to have a meaning if
nature had not proved treacherous. She gave
them berries and bananas, sunshine and soft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
breezes, but she gave them trouble also in the
shape of wild beasts, and savages, terrible
droughts, winds, and floods. In order to fight
against these enemies, strength was necessary,
and when primitive men discovered that two
were worth twice as much as one they began to
join forces. This was the beginning of civilization
and of politeness. It rose out of the oldest
instinct in the world&mdash;self-preservation.</p>

<p>When men first organized into groups the
units were small, a mere handful of people under
a chief, but gradually they became larger and
larger until the nations of to-day have grown
into a sort of world community composed of
separate countries, each one supreme in its own
domain, but at the same time bound to the others
by economic ties stronger than sentimental or
political ones could ever be. People are now
more dependent on one another than they have
ever been before, and the need for confidence is
greater. We cannot depend upon one another
unless we can trust one another.</p>

<p>The American community is in many respects
the most complex the world has ever seen, and
the hardest to manage. In other countries the
manners have been the natural result of the
national development. The strong who had
risen to the top in the struggle for existence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
formed themselves into a group. The weak who
stayed at the bottom fell into another, and the
bulk of the populace, which, then as now, came
somewhere in between, fell into a third or was
divided according to standards of its own. Custom
solidified the groups into classes which became
so strengthened by years of usage that even
when formal distinctions were broken down the
barriers were still too solid for a man who was
born into a certain group to climb very easily
into the one above him. Custom also dictated
what was expected of the several classes. Each
must be gracious to those below and deferential
to those above. The king, because he was king,
must be regal. The nobility must, <i>noblesse
oblige</i>, be magnificent, and as for the rest of the
people, it did not matter much so long as they
worked hard and stayed quiet. There were upheavals,
of course, and now and then a slave with
a braver heart and a stouter spirit than his companions
incited them to rebellion. His head was
chopped off for his pains and he was promptly
forgotten. The majority of the people for thousands
of years honestly believed that this was the
only orderly basis upon which society could be
organized.</p>

<p>Nebulous ideas of a brotherhood, in which each
man was to have an equal chance with every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
other, burned brightly for a little while in various
parts of the world at different times, and flickered
out. They broke forth with the fury of an
explosion in France during the Revolution and
in Russia during the Red Terror. They have
smoldered quietly in some places and had just
begun to break through with a steady, even
flame. But America struck the match and gathered
the wood to start her own fire. She is the
first country in the world which was founded especially
to promote individual freedom and the
brotherhood of mankind. She had, to change
the figure slightly, a blue-print to start with and
she has been building ever since.</p>

<p>Her material came from the eastern hemisphere.
The nations there at the time when the
United States was settled were at different
stages of their development. Some were vigorous
with youth, some were in the height of their
glory, and some were dying because the descendants
of the men who had made them great were
futile and incapable. These nations were different
in race and religion, in thought, language,
traditions, and temperament. When they were
not quarreling with each other, they were busy
with domestic squabbles. They had kept this
up for centuries and were at it when the settlers
landed at Jamestown and later when the <i>May<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>flower</i>
came to Plymouth Rock. Yet, with a
cheerful disregard of the past and an almost sublime
hope in the future they expected to live happily
ever after they crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
Needless to add, they did not.</p>

<p>Accident of place cannot change a man's
color (though it may bleach it a shade lighter or
tan it a shade darker), nor his religion nor any of
the other racial and inherent qualities which are
the result of slow centuries of development.
And the same elements which made men fight in
the old countries set them against each other in
the new. Most of the antagonisms were and
are the result of prejudices, foolish narrow prejudices,
which, nevertheless, must be beaten
down before we can expect genuine courtesy.</p>

<p>Further complications arose, and are still arising,
from the fact that we did not all get here at
the same time. Those who came first have inevitably
and almost unconsciously formulated
their own system of manners. Wherever there
is community life and a certain amount of leisure
there is a standard of cultivated behavior. And
America, young as she is, has already accumulated
traditions of her own.</p>

<p>It is beyond doubt that the men who came
over in the early days were, as a rule, better timber
than the ones who come now. They came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
live and die, if necessary, for a religious or a political
principle, for adventure, or like the debtors
in Oglethorpe's colony in Georgia, to wipe
clean the slate of the past and begin life again.
To-day they come to make money or because
they think they will find life easier here than it
was where they were. And one of the chief reasons
for the discontent and unrest (and, incidentally,
rudeness) which prevails among them
is that they find it hard. We are speaking in
general terms. There are glorious exceptions.</p>

<p>The sturdy virtues of the pioneers did not include
politeness. They never do. So long as
there is an animal fear of existence man cannot
think of minor elegances. He cannot live by
bread alone, but he cannot live at all without it.
Bread must come first. And the Pilgrim Father
was too busy learning how to wring a living from
the forbidding rocks of New England with one
hand while he fought off the Indians with the
other to give much time to tea parties and luncheons.
Nowhere in America except in the South,
where the leisurely life of the plantations gave
opportunity for it, was any great attention paid
to formal courtesy. But everywhere, as soon as
the country had been tamed and prosperity began
to peep over the horizon, the pioneers began
to grow polite. They had time for it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>What we must remember&mdash;and this is a reason,
not an excuse, for bad manners&mdash;is that these
new people coming into the country, the present-day
immigrants, are pioneers, and that the life
is not an easy one whether it is lived among a
wilderness of trees and beasts in a forest or a
wilderness of men and buildings in a city. The
average American brings a good many charges
against the foreigner&mdash;some of them justified,
for much of the &ldquo;back-wash&rdquo; of Europe and
Asia has drifted into our harbor&mdash;but he must
remember this: Whatever his opinion of the
immigrant may be the fault is ours&mdash;he came
into this country under the sanction of our laws.
And he is entitled to fair and courteous treatment
from every citizen who lives under the folds
of the American flag.</p>

<p>The heterogeneous mixture which makes up
our population is a serious obstacle (but not an
insuperable one) in the way of courtesy, but
there is another even greater. The first is
America's problem. The second belongs to the
world.</p>

<p>Material progress has raced so far ahead of
mental and spiritual progress that the world itself
is a good many years in advance of the people
who are living in it. Our statesmen ride to
Washington in automobiles and sleeping cars,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
but they are not vastly preferable to those who
went there in stagecoaches and on horseback.
In other words, there has been considerably more
improvement in the vehicles which fill our highways
than there has been in the people who ride
in them.</p>

<p>The average man&mdash;who is, when all is said and
done, the most important person in the state&mdash;has
stood still while the currents of science and
invention have swept past him. He has watched
the work of the world pass into the keeping of
machines, shining miracles of steel and electricity,
and has forgot himself in worshipping them.
Now he is beginning to realize that it is much
easier to make a perfect machine than it is to
find a perfect man to put behind it, and that man
himself, even at his worst (and that is pretty
bad) is worth more than anything else in the
scheme of created things.</p>

<p>This tremendous change in environment resulting
from the overwhelming domination of
machinery has brought about a corresponding
change in manners. For manners consist, in the
main, of adapting oneself to one's surroundings.
And the story of courtesy is the story of evolution.</p>

<p>It is interesting to run some of our conventions
back to their origin. Nearly every one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
them grew out of a practical desire for lessening
friction or making life pleasanter. The first
gesture of courtesy was, no doubt, some form of
greeting by which one man could know another
as a friend and not an enemy. They carried
weapons then as habitually as they carry watches
to-day and used them as frequently, so that when
a man approached his neighbor to talk about the
prospects of the sugar or berry crop he held out
his right hand, which was the weapon hand, as a
sign of peace. This eventually became the handshake.
Raising one's hat is a relic of the days
of chivalry when knights wore helmets which
they removed when they came into the house,
both because they were more comfortable without
them and because it showed their respect for
the ladies, whom it was their duty to serve. And
nearly every other ceremony which has lasted
was based on common sense. &ldquo;Etiquette,&rdquo; as
Dr. Brown has said, &ldquo;with all its littlenesses and
niceties, is founded upon a central idea of right
and wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; itself did not come into
the language until late (etiquette came even
later) and then it was used to describe the polite
practices at court. It was wholly divorced from
any idea of character, and the most fastidious
gentlemen were sometimes the most complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
scoundrels. Even the authors of books of etiquette
were men of great superficial elegance
whose moral standards were scandalously low.
One of them, an Italian, was banished from court
for having published an indecent poem and
wrote his treatise on polite behavior while he
was living in enforced retirement in his villa outside
the city. It was translated for the edification
of the young men of England and France
and served as a standard for several generations.
Another, an Englishman, spent the later years of
his life writing letters to his illegitimate son, telling
him exactly how to conduct himself in the
courtly (and more or less corrupt) circles to
which his noble rank entitled him. The letters
were bound into a fat, dreary volume which still
sits on the dust-covered shelves of many a library,
and the name of the author has become a synonym
for exquisite manners. Influential as he
was in his own time, however, neither he nor any
of the others of the early arbiters of elegance
could set himself up as a dictator of what is polite
to American men, of no matter what class, and
get by with it. Not very far by, at any rate.</p>

<p>It is impossible now to separate courtesy and
character. Politeness is a fundamental, not a
superficial, thing. It is the golden rule translated
into terms of conduct. It is not a white-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>wash
which, if laid on thick enough, will cover
every defect. It is a clear varnish which shows
the texture and grain of the wood beneath. In
the ideal democracy the ideal citizen is the man
who is not only incapable of doing an ungallant
or an ungracious thing, but is equally incapable
of doing an unmanly one. There is no use lamenting
the spacious days of long ago. Wishing
for them will not bring them back. Our
problem is to put the principles of courtesy into
practice even in this hurried and hectic Twentieth
Century of ours. And since the business man is
in numbers, and perhaps in power also, the most
consequential person in the country, it is of most
importance that he should have a high standard
of behavior, a high standard of civility, which
includes not only courtesy but everything which
has to do with good citizenship.</p>

<p>We have no desire for candy-box courtesy. It
should be made of sterner stuff. Nor do we care
for the sort which made the polite Frenchman
say, &ldquo;Excusez-moi&rdquo; when he stabbed his adversary.
We can scarcely hope just yet to attain
to the magnificent calm which enabled Marie
Antoinette to say, &ldquo;I'm sorry. I did not do it
on purpose,&rdquo; when she stepped on the foot of her
executioner as they stood together on the scaffold,
or Lord Chesterfield, gentleman to the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
end, to say, &ldquo;Give Dayrolles a chair&rdquo; when his
physician came into the room in which he lay dying.
But we do want something that will enable
us to live together in the world with a minimum
degree of friction.</p>

<p>The best of us get on one another's nerves,
even under ordinary conditions, and it takes infinite
pains and self-control to get through a trying
day in a busy office without striking sparks
somewhere. If there is a secret of success, and
some of the advertisements seem trying to persuade
us that it is all secret, it is the ability to
work efficiently and pleasantly with other people.
The business man never works alone. He
is caught in the clutches of civilization and there
is no escape. He is like a man climbing a mountain
tied to a lot of other men climbing the same
mountain. What each one does affects all the
others.</p>

<p>We do not want our people to devote themselves
entirely to the art of being agreeable. If
we could conceive of a world where everybody
was perfectly polite and smiling all the time we
should hardly like to live in it. It is human nature
not to like perfection, and most of us, if
brought face to face with that model of behavior,
Mr. Turveydrop, who spent his life serving as a
pattern of deportment, would sympathize with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the delightful old lady who looked at him in the
full flower of his glory and cried viciously (but
under her breath) &ldquo;I could bite you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Pope Benedict XI sent a messenger to
Giotto for a sample of his work the great artist
drew a perfect circle with one sweep of his arm
and gave it to the boy. Before his death Giotto
executed many marvelous works of art, not one
of them perfect, not even the magnificent bell
tower at Florence, but all of them infinitely
greater than the circle. It is better, whether
one is working with bricks or souls, to build

<h3>THE VALUE OF COURTESY</h3>

<p>Every progressive business man will agree
with the successful Western manufacturer who
says that &ldquo;courtesy can pay larger dividends in
proportion to the effort expended than any other
of the many human characteristics which might
be classed as Instruments of Accomplishment.&rdquo;
But this was not always true. In the beginning
&ldquo;big business&rdquo; assumed an arrogant, high-handed
attitude toward the public and rode
rough-shod over its feelings and rights whenever
possible. This was especially the case among
the big monopolies and public service corporations,
and much of the antagonism against the
railroads to-day is the result of the methods they
used when they first began to lay tracks and
carry passengers. Nor was this sort of thing
limited to the large concerns. Small business
consisted many times of trickery executed according
to David Harum's motto of &ldquo;Do unto
the other feller as he would like to do unto
you, but do him fust.&rdquo; The public is a long-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>suffering
body and the business man is a hard-headed
one, but after a while the public began to
realize that it was not necessary to put up with
gross rudeness and the business man began to realize
that a policy of pleasantness was much better
than the &ldquo;treat 'em rough&rdquo; idea upon which
he had been acting. He deserves no special credit
for it. It was as simple and as obvious a thing
as putting up an umbrella when it is raining.</p>

<p>People knew, long before this enlightened era
of ours, that politeness had value. In one of the
oldest books of good manners in the English
language a man with &ldquo;an eye to the main chance&rdquo;
advised his pupils to cultivate honesty, gentleness,
propriety, and deportment because they
paid. But it has not been until recently that
business men as a whole have realized that courtesy
is a practical asset to them. Business cannot
be separated from money and there is no use
to try. Men work that they may live. And the
reason they have begun to develop and exploit
courtesy is that they have discovered that it
makes for better work and better living. Success,
they have learned, in spite of the conspicuous
wealth of several magnates who got their
money by questionable means, depends upon
good will and good will depends upon the square
deal courteously given.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The time is within the memory of living men, and
very young men at that, when the idea of putting
courtesy into business dealings sprang up, but it
has taken hold remarkably. When the Hudson
Tubes were opened not quite a decade and a half
ago Mr. McAdoo inaugurated what was at that
time an almost revolutionary policy. He took
the motto, &ldquo;The Public be Pleased,&rdquo; instead of
the one made famous by Mr. Vanderbilt, and
posted it all about, had pamphlets distributed,
and made a speech on courtesy in railroad management
and elsewhere. Since that time, not
altogether because of the precedent which had
been established, but because people were beginning
to realize that with this new element creeping
into business the old r&eacute;gime had to die because
it could not compete with it, there have
been all sorts of courtesy campaigns among railroad
and bus companies, and even among post
office and banking employees, to mention only
two of the groups notorious for haughty and
arrogant behavior. The effects of a big telephone
company have been so strenuous and so
well planned and executed that they are reserved
for discussion in another chapter.</p>

<p>Mr. McAdoo tells a number of charming
stories which grew out of the Hudson Tubes experiment.
One day during a political convention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
when he was standing in the lobby of a hotel in
a certain city a jeweler came over to him after
a slight moment of hesitation, gave him one of
his cards and said, &ldquo;Mr. McAdoo, I owe you a
great debt of gratitude. For that,&rdquo; he added,
pointing to &ldquo;The Public be Pleased&rdquo; engraved
in small letters on the card just above his name.
&ldquo;I was in New York the day the tunnel was
opened,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and I heard your speech,
and said to myself that it might be a pretty good
idea to try that in the jewelry trade. And would
you believe it, my profits during the first year
were more than fifty per cent bigger than they
were the year before?&rdquo; And we venture to add
that the jeweler was more than twice as happy
and that it was not altogether because there was
more money in his coffers.</p>

<p>Mr. McAdoo is a man with whom courtesy is
not merely a policy: it is a habit as well. He
places it next to integrity of character as a qualification
for a business man, and he carries it into
every part of his personal activity, as the statesmen
and elevator boys, waiters and financiers,
politicians and stenographers with whom he has
come into contact can testify. &ldquo;I never have a
secretary,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;who is not courteous, no
matter what his other qualifications may be.&rdquo;
During the past few years Mr. McAdoo has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
placed in a position to be sought after by all
kinds of people, and in nearly every instance he
has given an interview to whoever has asked for
it. &ldquo;I have always felt,&rdquo; we quote him again,
&ldquo;that a public servant should be as accessible to
the public as possible.&rdquo; Courtesy with him, as
with any one else who makes it a habit, has a
cumulative effect. The effect cannot always be
traced as in the case of the jeweler or in the story
given below in which money plays a very negligible
part, but it is always there.</p>

<p>On one occasion&mdash;this was when he was president
of the Hudson Railroad&mdash;Mr. McAdoo
was on his way up to the Adirondacks when the
train broke down. It was ill provided for such
a catastrophe, there was no dining car, only a
small buffet, and the wait was a long and trying
one. When Mr. McAdoo after several hours
went back to the buffet to see if he could get a
cup of coffee and some rolls he found the conductor
almost swamped by irate passengers who
blamed him, in the way that passengers will, for
something that was no more his fault than theirs.
The conductor glanced up when Mr. McAdoo
came in, expecting him to break into an explosion
of indignation, but Mr. McAdoo said,
&ldquo;Well, you have troubles enough already without
my adding to them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conductor stepped out of the group.
&ldquo;What did you want, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing, now,&rdquo; Mr. McAdoo responded.
&ldquo;I did want a cup of coffee, but never
mind about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the smoker here,&rdquo; the conductor
said. &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conductor disappeared and came back in
a few minutes with coffee, bread, and butter.
Mr. McAdoo thanked him warmly, gave him his
card and told him that if he ever thought he
could do anything for him to let him know. The
conductor looked at the card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the president of the Hudson Railroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe there's something you can do
for me now. There are two men out here who
say they are going to report me for what happened
this morning. You know how things have
been, and if they do, I wish you would write to
headquarters and explain. I'm in line for promotion
and you know what a black mark means
in a case like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. McAdoo assured him that he would write
if it became necessary. The men were bluffing,
however, and the complaint was never sent in.
Apparently the incident was closed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Several years later Mr. McAdoo's son was
coming down from the Adirondacks when he lost
his Pullman ticket. He did not discover the
fact until he got to the station, and then he had
no money and no time to get any by wire before
the train left. He went to the conductor, explained
his dilemma, and told him that if he
would allow him to ride down to the city his
father, who was to meet him at the Grand Central
station, would pay him for the ticket. The
conductor liked the youngster&mdash;perhaps because
there was something about him that reminded
him of his father, for as chance would
have it, the conductor was the same one who
had brought Mr. McAdoo the coffee and
bread in the smoking car so many months
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your father?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. McAdoo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;President of the Hudson Railroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, you can have the train!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far as monetary value of courtesy is concerned
we might recount hundreds of instances
where a single act of politeness brought in thousands
of dollars. Only the other morning the
papers carried the story of a man who thirty
years ago went into a tailor's shop with a ragged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
tear in his trousers and begged the tailor to mend
it and to trust him for the payment which
amounted to fifty cents. The tailor agreed
cheerfully enough and the man went his way,
entered business and made a fortune. He died
recently and left the tailor fifty thousand dollars.
Not long before that there was a story of
an old woman who came to New York to visit
her nephew&mdash;it was to be a surprise&mdash;and lost
her bearings so completely when she got into the
station that she was about ready to turn around
and go back home when a very polite young man
noticed her bewilderment. He offered his services,
called a taxi and deposited her in front of
her nephew's door in half an hour. She took his
name and address and a few days later he received
a check large enough to enable him to
enter the Columbia Law School. A banker is
fond of telling the story of an old fellow who
came into his bank one day in a suit of black so
old that it had taken on a sickly greenish tinge.
He fell into the hands of a polite clerk who answered
all his questions&mdash;and there were a great
many of them&mdash;clearly, patiently, and courteously.
The old man went away but came back
in a day or so with $300,000 which he placed on
deposit. &ldquo;I did have some doubts,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but this young man settled them all.&rdquo; Word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of it went to people in authority and the clerk
was promoted.</p>

<p>Now it is pleasant to know that these good
people were rewarded as they deserved to be.
We would be very happy if we could promise a
like reward to every one who is similarly kind,
but it is no use. The little words of love and the
little deeds of kindness go often without recompense
so far as we can see, except that they happify
the world, but that in itself is no small
return.</p>

<p>Courtesy pays in dollars and cents but its
value goes far beyond that. It is the chief element
in building good will&mdash;we are speaking
now of courtesy as an outgrowth of character&mdash;and
good will is to a firm what honor is to a man.
He can lose everything else but so long as he
keeps his honor he has something to build with.
In the same way a business can lose all its material
assets and can replace them with insurance
money or something else, but if it loses its good
will it will find in ninety cases out of a hundred
that it is gone forever and that the business itself
has become so weakened that there is nothing
left but to reorganize it completely and blot out
the old institution altogether.</p>

<p>One must not make the mistake of believing
that good will can be built on courtesy alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Courtesy must be backed up by something more
solid. An excellent comparison to show the relation
that good manners bear to uprightness
and integrity of character was drawn a number
of years ago by a famous Italian prelate. We
shall paraphrase the quaint English of the original
translator. &ldquo;Just as men do commonly
fear beasts that are cruel and wild,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;and have no manner of fear of little ones such
as gnats and flies, and yet because of the continual
nuisance which they find them, complain
more of these than they do of the other: so most
men hate the unmannerly and untaught as much
as they do the wicked, and more. There is no
doubt that he who wishes to live, not in solitary
and desert places, like a hermit, but in fellowship
with men, and in populous cities, will find it a
very necessary thing, to have skill to put himself
forth comely and seemly in his fashions, gestures,
and manners: the lack of which do make
other virtues lame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granting dependability of character, courtesy
is the next finest business builder an organization
can have. One of the largest trust companies
in the world was built up on this hypothesis. A
good many years ago the man who is responsible
for its growth was cashier in a &ldquo;busted&rdquo; bank in
a small city. The situation was a desperate one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
for the bank could not do anything more for its
customers than it was already doing. It could
not give them more interest on their money and
most of its other functions were mechanical. The
young cashier began to wonder why people went
to one bank in preference to another and in his
own mind drew a comparison between the banking
and the clothing business. He always went
to the haberdasher who treated him best. Other
men he knew did the same thing. Would not
the same principle work in a bank? Would not
people come to the place which gave them the
best service? He decided to try it. Not only
would they give efficient service, they would give
it pleasantly. It was their last card but it was
a trump. It won. The bank began to prosper.
People who were annoyed by rude, brusque, or
indifferent treatment in other banks came to this
one. The cashier was raised to a position of importance
and in an incredibly short time was
made president of a trust company in New York.
He carried with him exactly the same principle
that had worked so well in the little bank
and the result in the big one was exactly the
same.</p>

<p>In a leaflet which is in circulation among the
employees at this institution there are these paragraphs:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We ask you to remember:</p>

<p>That our customers <i>can</i> get along without us.</p>

<p>(There are in Greater New York nearly one hundred
banks and trust companies, every one of them actively
seeking business.)</p>

<p>We <i>cannot</i> get along without our customers.</p>

<p>A connection which, perhaps, it has taken us several
months to establish, can be terminated by one careless or
discourteous act.</p>

<p>Our customers are asked to maintain balances of certain
proportions. If they wish to borrow money, they
must deposit collateral. They must repay loans when they
mature; or arrange for their extension.</p>

<p>If a bank errs, it must err on the side of safety, for
the money it loans is not its own money but the money of
its depositors. We (and every other bank and trust company)
operate almost entirely on money which our customers
have deposited with us. The least we can do, then,
is to serve them courteously. They really are our employers.</p>

<p>Ours is a semi-public institution.</p>

<p>Every day, men try to interest us in matters with
which we have no concern. It is our duty to tell these
men, very courteously, why their proposals do not appeal
to us. But they are entitled to a hearing. It may be
that they are not in a position to benefit us, and never will
be. But almost every man can harm us, if he tries to do
so. And a pleasantly expressed declination invariably
makes a better impression than a favor grudgingly granted.
We ask you, then, to remember that our growth&mdash;and your
opportunities&mdash;depend not only upon the friends we make,
but <i>the enemies we do not make</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Remember names and faces. Do something, say something
that will bring home to those who do business with
us the fact that the Blank Trust Company is a very human
institution&mdash;that it wants the good will of every man and
woman in the country.</p></div>

<p>That is the kind of courtesy which has builded
this particular organization. It is a pleasure to
visit it to-day because of the spirit of co&ouml;peration
which animates it. They have done away
with the elaborate spy systems in use in so many
banks, although they keep the management well
enough in hand to be able to fasten the blame for
mistakes upon the right person. The employees
work with one another and with the president,
whom they adore. It is, as a matter of fact,
largely the influence of the personality of the
president filtering down through the ranks which
has made possible the phenomenal success which
the institution has enjoyed during the past few
years, another proof of the fact that every institution&mdash;and
Emerson was speaking of great institutions
when he said it&mdash;&ldquo;is the lengthened
shadow of one man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Banks have almost a peculiar problem. Money
is a mighty power, and to the average person
there is something very awesome about the place
where it is kept. Mr. Stephen Leacock is not
the only man who ever went into a bank with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
funny little guilty feeling even when he had
money in it. When one is in this frame of mind
it takes very little on the part of the clerk to
make him believe that he has been treated rudely.
Bank clerks are notoriously haughty, but the
fault is often as much in the person on the outside
as in the one on the inside of the bars, especially
when he has come in to draw out money
which he knows he should not, such as his savings
bank account, for instance. The other day a
young man went into a savings bank to draw
out all of his money for a purpose which he knew
was extravagant although he had persuaded
himself that it was not. Throughout the whole
time he was in the bank he was treated with perfect
courtesy, but in spite of it he came out growling
about &ldquo;the dirty look the paying teller gave
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not only in the first contact that civility
is important. Eternal vigilance is the price of
success as well as of liberty. Another incident
from the banking business illustrates this. Several
years ago a bank which had been steadily
losing customers called in a publicity expert to
build up trade for them. The man organized a
splendid campaign and things started off with a
flourish. People began to come in most gratifying
numbers. But they did not stay. An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
investigation conducted by the publicity man
disclosed the fact that they had been driven away
by negligent and discourteous service. He went
to the president of the bank and told him that he
was wasting money building up advertising so
long as his bank maintained its present attitude
toward the public. The president was a man
of practical sense. There was a general clearing
up, those who were past reform were discharged
and those who stayed were given careful training
in what good breeding meant and there was no
more trouble. Advertising will bring in a customer
but it takes courtesy to keep him.</p>

<p>Business, like nearly everything else, is easier
to tear down than to build up, and one of the
most devastating instruments of destruction is
discourtesy. A contact which has taken years
to build can be broken off by one snippy letter,
one pert answer, or one discourteous response
over the telephone. Even collection letters, no
matter how long overdue the accounts are, bring
in more returns when they are written with tact
and diplomacy than when these two qualities are
omitted. If you insult a man who owes you
money he feels that the only way he can get
even is not to pay you, and in most cases, he can
justify himself for not doing it.</p>

<p>Within the organization itself a courteous at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>titude
on the part of the men in positions of
authority toward those beneath them is of immense
importance. Sap rises from the bottom,
and a business has arrived at the point of stagnation
when the men at the top refuse to listen to or
help those around them. It is, as a rule, however,
not the veteran in commercial affairs but
the fledgling who causes most trouble by his bad
manners. Young men, especially young men
who have been fortunate in securing material advantages,
too many times look upon the world
as an accident placed here for their personal enjoyment.
It never takes long in business to relieve
their minds of this delusion, but they sometimes
accomplish a tremendous amount of damage
before it happens. For a pert, know-it-all
manner coupled with the inefficiency which is almost
inseparable from a total lack of experience
is not likely to make personal contacts pleasant.
Every young man worth his salt believes that he
can reform the world, but every old man who has
lived in it knows that it cannot be done. Somewhere
half way between they meet and say,
&ldquo;We'll keep working at it just the same,&rdquo; and
then business begins to pick up. But reaching
the meeting ground takes tolerance and patience
and infinite politeness from both sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the grossest sort of incivility,&rdquo; the quo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>tation
is not exact, for we do not remember the
source, &ldquo;to be contemptuous of any kind of
knowledge.&rdquo; And herein lies the difficulty between
the hard-headed business man of twenty
years' experience and the youngster upon whose
diploma the ink has not yet dried. &ldquo;Ignorance,&rdquo;
declares a man who has spent his life in
trying to draw capital and labor together and
has succeeded in hundreds of factories, &ldquo;is the
cause of all trouble.&rdquo; And a lack of understanding,
which is a form of ignorance, is the
cause of nearly all discourtesy.</p>

<p>So long as there is discourtesy in the world
there must be protection against it, and the best,
cheapest, and easiest means of protection is courtesy
itself. Boats which are in constant danger
of being run into, such as the tug and ferry boats
in a busy harbor, are fitted out with buffers or
fenders which are as much a part of their equipment
as the smokestack, and in many cases, as
necessary. Ocean liners carry fenders to be
thrown over the side when there is need for them,
but this naturally is not as often as in more
crowded waters. A single boat on a deserted
sea with nothing but sea-gulls and flying fish in
sight cannot damage any one besides herself. But
the moment she enters a harbor she has to take
into account every other vessel in it from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<i>Aquitania</i> to the flat-bottomed row-boat with
only one man in it. It is a remarkable fact that
most of the boats that are injured or sunk by
collision are damaged by vessels much smaller
than themselves. Most of these accidents (this
statement is given on the authority of an able
seaman) could have been prevented by the use of
a fender thrown over the side at the proper moment.
Politeness is like this. It is the finest
shock absorber in the world, as essential from an
economic point of view as it is pleasant from a
social one. In business there is no royal isolation.
We are all ferry boats. We need our
shock absorbers every minute of the day.</p>

<p>No boat has a right to run into another, but
they do it just the same, and a shock absorber is
worth all the curses the captain and the crew can
pronounce, however righteous their indignation
toward the offending vessel. Sometimes politeness
is better than justice.</p>

<p>Most of the causes of irritation during the
course of a business day are too petty to bother
about. Many of them could be ignored and a
good many more could be laughed at. A sense
of humor and a sense of proportion would do
away with ninety per cent of all the wrangling
in the world. Some one has said, and not without
truth, that a highly developed sense of humor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
would have prevented the World War. Too
many people use sledge-hammers when tack
hammers would do just as well. They belong in
the same company with William Jay whose immortal
epitaph bears these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here lies the body of William Jay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who died maintaining his right of way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was right, dead right, as he sped along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Courtesy is restful. A nervous frenzy of
energy throughout the day leaves one at sunset
as exhausted as a punctured balloon. The fussy
little fellow who fancies himself rushed to death,
who has no time to talk with anybody, who cannot
be polite to his stenographer and his messenger
boys because he is in such a terrible hurry, is
dissipating his energy into something that does
not matter and using up the vitality which should
go into his work. He is very like the engine
which President Lincoln was so fond of telling
about which used so much steam in blowing its
whistle that every time it did it it had to stop.</p>

<p>The Orientals manage things better than we
do. &ldquo;We tried hurrying two thousand years
ago,&rdquo; a banker in Constantinople said to a tired
American business man, &ldquo;and found that it did
not pay. So we gave it up.&rdquo; There is always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
time to be polite, and though it sounds like a
contradiction, there will be more time to spare if
one devotes a part of his day to courtesy.</p>

<p>But there is danger in too much courtesy.
Every virtue becomes a vice if it is carried too
far, and frank rudeness is better than servility
or hypocrisy. Commercial greed, there is no
other name for it, leads a firm to adopt some such
idiotic motto as &ldquo;the customer is always right.&rdquo;
No organization could ever live up to such a
policy, and the principle back of it is undemocratic,
un-American, unsound and untrue. The
customer is not always right and the employer in
a big (or little) concern who places girls (department
stores are the chief sinners in this) on
the front line of approach with any such instructions
is a menace to self-respecting business.
America does not want a serving class with a
&ldquo;king-can-do-no-wrong&rdquo; attitude toward the
public. Business is service, not servility, and
courtesy works both ways. There is no more
sense in business proclaiming that the customer
is always right than there would be in a customer
declaring that business is always right, and no
more truth.</p>

<p>No good business man will argue with a customer,
or anybody else, not only because it is bad
policy to do so, but because his self-respect will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
not allow it. He will give and require from his
employees courteous treatment toward his customers,
and when doubt arises he will give them
(the customers) the benefit of it. And he will
always remember that he is dealing with an intelligent
human being. The customer has a
right to expect a firm to supply him with reliable
commodities and to do it pleasantly, but he has
no right to expect it to prostrate itself at his feet
in order to retain his trade, however large that
trade may be.</p>

<p>Too little has been said about courtesy on the
part of the customer and the public&mdash;that great
headless mass of unrelated particles. Business
is service, we say, and the master is the public,
the hardest one in the world to serve. Each one
of us speaks with more or less pitying contempt
of the public, forgetting that we ourselves are
the public and that the sum total of the good
breeding, intelligence, and character of the public
can be no greater than that of the individuals
who make it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid,&rdquo; of the <i>American Magazine</i>, says that
he once asked the manager of a circus which
group of his employees he had most trouble
keeping. Quite unexpectedly the man replied,
&ldquo;The attendants. They get &lsquo;sucker-sore&rsquo; and
after that they are no good.&rdquo; This is how it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
happens. The wild man from Borneo is placed
in a cage with a placard attached bearing in big
letters the legend &ldquo;The Wild Man from Borneo.&rdquo;
An old farmer comes to the circus, looks
at the wild man from Borneo in his cage, reads
the placard, looks at the attendant, &ldquo;Is this the
wild man from Borneo?&rdquo; he asks. No human
being can stand an unlimited amount of this sort
of thing, and the attendant, after he has explained
some hundred thousand or so times that
this really is the wild man from Borneo begins to
lose his zest for it and to answer snappishly and
sarcastically. An infinite supply of courtesy
would, of course, be a priceless asset to him, but
does not this work both ways? What right have
people to bother other people with perfectly foolish
and imbecile questions? Is there any one
who cannot sympathize with a &ldquo;sucker-sore&rdquo;
attendant? And with the people who are stationed
about for the purpose of answering questions
almost anywhere? There are not many of
us who at one time and another have not had the
feeling that we were on the wrong train even
after we had asked the man who sold us the
ticket, the man who punched it at the gate, the
guard who was standing near the entrance, and
the guard who was standing near the train, the
porter, the conductor, and the news-butcher if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
was the right one and have had an affirmative answer
from every one of them. How many times
can a man be expected to answer such a question
with a smile? For those who are exposed to
&ldquo;suckers&rdquo; the best advice is to be as gentle with
them as possible, to grit your teeth and hold your
temper even when the ninety-thousandth man
comes through to ask if this is the right train.
For the &ldquo;suckers&rdquo; themselves there are only two
words of advice. They include all the rest: Stop
it.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell what the value of courtesy
is. Perhaps some day the people who have
learned to measure our minds will be able to tell
us just what a smile is worth. Maybe they can
tell us also what Spring is worth, and what happiness
is worth. Meanwhile we do not know.
We only know that they are infinitely precious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h3>PUTTING COURTESY INTO BUSINESS</h3>

<p>We talk a great deal about gentlemen and
about democracy and a good many other words
which describe noble conceptions without a very
clear idea of what they mean. The biggest mistake
we make is in thinking of them as something
stationary like a monument carved in granite or
a stone set upon a hill, when the truth is that they
are living ideas subject to the change and growth
of all living things. No man has ever yet become
a perfect gentleman because as his mind
has developed his conception of what a gentleman
is has enlarged, just as no country has ever
become a perfect democracy because each new
idea of freedom has led to broader ideas of freedom.
It is very much like walking through a
tunnel. At first there is only darkness, and then
a tiny pin point of light ahead which grows wider
and wider as one advances toward it until, finally,
he stands out in the open with the world be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>fore
him. There is no end to life, and none to
human development, at least none that can be
conceived of by the finite mind of man.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of definitions of a gentleman,
none of them altogether satisfactory. Cardinal
Newman says it is almost enough to say
that he is one who never gives pain. &ldquo;They be
the men,&rdquo; runs an old chronicle, &ldquo;whom their
race and bloud, or at the least, their virtues, do
make noble and knowne.&rdquo; Barrow declares that
they are the men lifted above the vulgar crowd
by two qualities: courage and courtesy. The
Century Dictionary, which is as good an authority
as any, says, &ldquo;A gentleman is a man of
good breeding, courtesy, and kindness; hence, a
man distinguished for fine sense of honor, strict
regard for his obligations, and consideration for
the rights and feelings of others.&rdquo; And this is
a good enough working standard for anybody.
The Dictionary is careful to make&mdash;and this is
important&mdash;a gentleman not one who conforms
to an outward and conventional standard, but
one who follows an inward and personal ideal.</p>

<p>Of late days there has been a great deal of
attention paid to making gentlemen of business
men and putting courtesy into all the ramifications
of business. Without doubt the chief reason
for it is the fact that business men themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
have discovered that it pays. One restaurant
frankly adopted the motto, &ldquo;Courtesy Pays,&rdquo;
and had it all fixed up with gilt letters and
framed and hung it near the front door, and a
number of other places have exactly the same
policy for exactly the same reason though they
do not all proclaim the fact so boldly. It is not
the loftiest motive in the world but it is an intelligent
one, and it is better for a man to be polite
because he hopes to win success that way than
for him not to be polite at all.</p>

<p>Human conduct, even at its best, is not always
inspired by the highest possible motives. Not
even the religions which men have followed have
been able to accomplish this. Most of them have
held out the hope of heavenly reward in payment
for goodness here on earth and countless millions
of men (and women, too, for that matter)
have kept in the straight and narrow path because
they were afraid to step out of it. It may
be that they were, intrinsically, no better men
than the ones who trod the primrose path to
the everlasting bonfire, but they were much
easier to live with. And the man who is courteous,
who is a gentleman, whatever his motives,
is a more agreeable citizen than the one who is
not.</p>

<p>Now how&mdash;this is our problem&mdash;does one go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
about making a gentleman? Environment plays,
comparatively speaking, a very small part. &ldquo;The
appellation of gentleman,&rdquo; this is from a gentleman
of the Seventeenth Century, &ldquo;is not to be
affixed to a man's circumstances, but to his behavior
in them.&rdquo; It is extremely doubtful if
courtesy can be taught by rule. It is more a
matter of atmosphere, and an instinct &ldquo;for the
better side of things and the cleaner surfaces of
life.&rdquo; And yet, heredity, training, and environment
all enter into the process.</p>

<p>It is a polite and pleasant fiction that courtesy
is innate and not acquired, and we hear a
great deal about the &ldquo;born lady&rdquo; and the &ldquo;born
gentleman.&rdquo; They are both myths. Babies
are not polite, and the &ldquo;king upon 'is throne with
'is crown upon 'is 'ead&rdquo; has had, if he is a gentleman,
life-long training in the art of being one.
There is still in existence a very interesting outline
which was given by Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert to their oldest son, the Prince of
Wales, on his seventeenth birthday. It contained
a careful summary of what was expected
of him as a Christian gentleman and included
such items as dress, appearance, deportment, relations
with other people, and ability to acquit
himself well in whatever company he happened
to be thrown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The King and Queen, although they were probably
unaware of the fact, were acting upon the
advice of an authority on good manners at court
a number of years before their time. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;
says the old manuscript, &ldquo;from seven to
seventeen young gentlemen commonly are carefully
enough brought up: but from seventeen to
seven-and-twenty (the most dangerous time of
all a man's life, and the most slippery to stay
well in) they have commonly the rein of all license
in their own hand, and specially such as do
live in the court.&rdquo; If we bring the sentence up
to date, and it is as true now as it was then, we
may substitute &ldquo;business&rdquo; for &ldquo;court.&rdquo; Business
men as well as courtiers find the ages between
seventeen and seven-and-twenty &ldquo;the most
slippery to stay well in&rdquo; for it is during these
years that they are establishing themselves in the
commercial world. As a general thing, but it is
wise to remember that there is no rule to which
there are not exceptions, by the time a man is
twenty-seven his habits are formed and it is too
late to acquire new ones.</p>

<p>Most children undergo a painstaking and
more or less painful course of instruction in good
manners and know by the time they are men and
women what should be done whether they do it
or not. Our social code is not a complicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
one, and there is no excuse except for the youngsters
who have just growed up like Topsy or
have been brought up by jerks like Pip. It is,
without doubt, easier to be polite among people
who are naturally courteous than among those
who snap and snarl at one another, but it is a
mistake to place too much emphasis on this part
of it. Too many men&mdash;business men, at that&mdash;have
come up out of the mire for us to be able to
offer elaborate apologies for those who have
stayed in it. The background is of minor importance.
A cockroach is a cockroach anywhere
you put him.</p>

<p>It is easy to envy the men who have had superior
advantages, and many a man feels that if
he had another's chance he, too, might have become
a great gentleman. It is an idle speculation.
His own opportunities are the only ones
any man can attend to, and if he is sensible he
will take quick advantage of those that come, not
in dreams, but in reality, and will remember what
a very sagacious English statesman said about
matters of even graver import: &ldquo;It makes no difference
where you are going. You've got to
start from where you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lack of early training is a handicap but
not a formidable one, especially to a business
man. As the Spaniards say, there is little curi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>osity
about the pedigree of a good man. And
no man needs to be ashamed of his origin. The
president of a firm would naturally be interested
in the ancestry of a young man who came to ask
him for the hand of his daughter, but if the man
has come to sell a bill of goods he does not care a
snap. In discussions of the social evil it is often
said that every child has a right to be well born,
but Robert Louis Stevenson saw more deeply
and spoke more truly when he said, &ldquo;We are all
nobly born; fortunate those who know it; blessed
those who remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The finest Gentleman the world has ever seen
was born some two thousand years ago to the
wife of a carpenter in Bethlehem and spent most
of His time among fishermen, tax-collectors,
cripples, lepers, and outcasts of various sorts;
and yet in the entire record of His short and
troubled life there is not one mention of an ungraceful
or an ungainly action. He was careful
to observe even the trivialities of social life.
Mary and Martha were quarreling before dinner.
He quieted them with a few gracious
words. The people at the marriage feast at
Cana were worried because they had only water
to drink. He touched it and gave them wine.
The multitude who came to hear Him were tired,
footsore, and hungry. He asked them to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
seated and gave them food. He dined with the
Pharisees, He talked with the women of Samaria,
He comforted Mary Magdalen, and He
washed the feet of His disciples. He was beset
and harassed by a thousand rude and unmannerly
questions, but not once did He return an
impatient answer. Surely these things are godlike
and divine whatever one may believe about
the relation of Jesus Christ to God, the Father.</p>

<p>It has been said that every man should choose
a gentleman for his father. He should also
choose a gentleman for his employer. Unfortunately
he often has no more option in the one
than he has in the other. Very few of us get exactly
what we want. But however this may be,
a gentleman at the head of a concern is a priceless
asset. The atmosphere of most business
houses is determined by the man at the top. His
character filters down through the ranks. If he
is a rough-and-tumble sort of person the office is
likely to be that kind of place; if he is quiet and
mannerly the chances are that the office will be
quiet and mannerly. If he is a gentleman everybody
in the place will know it and will feel the
effects of it. &ldquo;I am always glad John was with
Mr. Blank his first year in business,&rdquo; said a
mother speaking of her son. Mr. Blank was a
man who had a life-long reputation for being as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
straight as a shingle and as clean as a hound's
tooth, every inch a gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you account for the fact that you
have come to place so much emphasis on courtesy?&rdquo;
a business man was asked one day as he
sat in his upholstered office with great windows
opening out on the New York harbor. He
thought for a moment, and his mind went back
to the little Georgia village where he was born
and brought up. &ldquo;My father was a gentleman,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;I remember when I was a boy
he used to be careful about such trifles as this:
&lsquo;Now, Jim,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;when you stop on the
sidewalk don't stop in the middle of it. Stand
aside so you won't be in anybody's way.&rsquo; And
even now,&rdquo; the man smiled, &ldquo;I never stop on
the sidewalk without stepping to one side so as to
be out of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The life of a young person is plastic, easy to
take impressions, strong to retain them. And
the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; or the &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; whether he is
father, friend, or employer, or all three, has infinitely
more influence than either he or the
young man realizes. At the same time it is perfectly
true that young people do not believe
what older ones tell them about life. They have
to try it out for themselves. One generation
does not begin where the other left off. Each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
one of us begins at the beginning, and the
world, with all that it holds, is as wonderful
(though slightly different, to be sure) and as
new to the child who is born into it to-day as it
was to Adam on the first morning after it was
created.</p>

<p>It is almost tragic that so many young men
take the tenor of their lives from that of their employers,
especially if the latter have been successful.
This places a terrific responsibility upon
the employer which does not, however, shift it
from the employee. His part in business or in
life&mdash;and this is true of all of us&mdash;is what he
makes it, great or small. And the most important
thing is for him to have a personal ideal of
what he thinks best and hold to it. He cannot
get it from the outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Courtesy is not one of the company's rules,&rdquo;
wrote the manager of a large organization which
has been very successful in handling men and
making money. &ldquo;It is a tradition, an instinct.
It is an attribute of the general tone, of the dominating
influence of the management in all its
relations. It is a part of the general tone, the
honor, the integrity of the company. For three
generations it has been looked upon as an inheritance
to be preserved and kept irreproachable.
Employees are drawn into this influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
by the very simple process of their own development.
Those who find themselves in harmony
with the character of the company or who deliberately
put themselves in tune, progress. Those
who do not, cannot, for long, do congenial or acceptable
service.&rdquo; This is the statement from
the manager of a firm that is widely known for
courteous dealing. Their standard is now established.
It is a part of the atmosphere, and
their chief problem is to get men who will fit
into it.</p>

<p>An employer does not judge a man on an abstract
basis. He takes him because he thinks he
will be useful to his business. This is why most
places like to get men when they are young.
They are easier to train.</p>

<p>Every one likes good material to work with,
and employers are no exception. They take the
best they can find, and the higher the standard
of the firm the greater the care expended in
choosing the employees. &ldquo;Whenever we find a
good man,&rdquo; said the manager of a big trust company,
&ldquo;we take him on. We may not have a
place for him at the time but we keep him until
we find one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Except during times of stress such as that
brought about by the war when the soldiers were
at the front, no business house hires people in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>discriminately.
They know, as the Chinese have
it, that rotten wood cannot be carved. &ldquo;It is
our opinion,&rdquo; we quote from another manager,
&ldquo;that courtesy cannot be pounded into a person
who lacks proper social basis. In other words,
there are some people who would be boorish under
any circumstances. Our first and chief
step toward courtesy is to exercise care in
selecting our employees. We weigh carefully
each applicant for a sales position and try
to visualize his probable deportment as our
representative, and unless he gives promise of
being a fit representative we do not employ
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it is not enough to take a man into a business
organization. Every newcomer must be
broken in. Sometimes this is done by means of
formal training, sometimes it consists merely of
giving him an idea of what is expected of him
and letting him work out his own salvation.
Granting that he is already familiar with the
work in a general way, and that he is intelligent
and resourceful, he ought to be able to adapt
himself without a great deal of instruction from
above. All of this depends upon the kind of
work which is to be done.</p>

<p>Nearly every employer exercises more caution
in selecting the man who is to meet the public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
than any other. It is through him that the all-important
first impression is made, and a man
who is rude or discourteous, or who, for any reason,
rubs people the wrong way, simply will
not do. He may have many virtues but unless
they are apparent they are for the time being of
little service.</p>

<p>Most salesmen have to go to school. Their
work consists largely of the study of one of the
most difficult subjects in the catalogue: human
psychology. They must know why men do what
they do and how to make them do what they, the
salesmen, want them to do. They must be able
to handle the most delicate situations courteously
and without friction. It takes the tact of a
diplomat, the nerve of a trapeze performer, the
physical strength of a prize fighter, the optimism
of William J. Bryan or of Pollyanna, and the
wisdom of Solomon. Not many men are born
with this combination of qualities.</p>

<p>The best training schools base their teaching
on character and common sense. One very remarkable
organization, which has at its head an
astonishingly buoyant and optimistic&mdash;and, it
is hardly necessary to add, successful&mdash;man,
teaches that character is nine-tenths of success
in salesmanship and technique is only one-tenth.
They study technique and character along with it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in a scientific way, like the students in a biological
laboratory who examine specimens. Their
prospects are their subjects, and while they do
not actually bring them into the consultation
room, they hold experience meetings and tell
the stories of their successful and unsuccessful
contacts. The meetings are held at the end
of the day, when the men are all tired and
many of them are depressed and discouraged.
They are opened with songs, &ldquo;My Old Kentucky
Home,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Black Joe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet Adeline,&rdquo;
and the other good old familiar favorites
that make one think of home and mother
and school days and happiness. One or two
catchy popular songs are introduced, and the
men sing or hum or whistle or divide into groups
and do all three with all their might. It is irresistible.
Fifteen or twenty minutes of it can
wipe out the sourest memory of the day's business,
and trivial irritations sink to their proper
place in the scheme of things. The little speeches
follow, and the men clap and cheer for the ones
who have done good work and try to make an intelligent
diagnosis of the cases of the ones who
have not. When the leader talks he sometimes
recounts his early experiences&mdash;he, like most
good salesmanagers, was once on the road himself&mdash;and
if he is in an inspirational mood, gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
a sound talk on the principle back of the golden
rule. The spirit of co&ouml;peration throughout the institution
is amazing and the morale is something
any group of workers might well envy them.</p>

<p>Most business houses recognize their responsibilities
toward the young people that they hire.
Well-organized concerns build up from within.
The heads of the departments are for the most
part men who have received their training in the
institution, and they take as much pains in selecting
their office boys as they do in selecting
any other group, for it is in them that they see
the future heads and assistant heads of the departments.
In hiring office boys &ldquo;cleanness,
good manners, good physique, mental agility,
and good habits are primary requisites,&rdquo; according
to Mr. J. Ogden Armour in the <i>American
Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>In one of the oldest banks in New York each
boy who enters is given a few days' intensive
training by a gentleman chosen for the purpose.
The instructor stresses the fundamentals of
character and, above all things, common sense.
Courtesy is rarely discussed as a separate quality
but simple instructions are given about not going
in front of a person when there is room to go
around him, not pushing into an elevator ahead
of every one else, not speaking to a man at a desk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
until he has signified that he is ready, and about
sustaining quiet and orderly behavior everywhere.
The atmosphere in the bank is the kind
that encourages gentlemanly conduct and the
new boys either fall in with it or else get out and
go somewhere else.</p>

<p>It takes more patience on the part of the
youngsters in the financial district than it does
in most other places, for the men there work
under high tension and are often cross, worried,
nervous, and irritable, and as a result are, many
times, without intending it, unjust. The discipline
is severe, and the boy would not be human
if he did not resent it. But the youngster who
is quick to fly off the handle will find himself
sadly handicapped, however brilliant he may be,
in the race with boys who can keep their tempers
in the face of an injury.</p>

<p>Three boys out of the hundreds who have
passed through the training school in the bank
of which we were speaking have been discharged
for acts of discourtesy. One flipped a rubber
clip across a platform and hit one of the officials
in the eye, one refused to stay after hours to finish
some work he had neglected during the day,
and one was impertinent. All three could have
stayed if each had used a little common sense,
and all three could have stayed if each act had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
not been a fair indication of his general attitude
toward his work.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult organizations to manage
and one against which the charge of discourtesy
is frequently brought is the department
store. Yet a distinguished Englishwoman visiting
here&mdash;it takes a woman to judge these things&mdash;said,
&ldquo;I had always been told that people in
New York were in such a hurry that, although
well-meaning enough, they were inclined to appear
somewhat rude to strangers. I have found
it to be just the reverse. During my first strolls
in the streets, in the shops, and elsewhere, I have
found everybody most courteous. Your stores,
I may say, are the finest I have ever seen, not excepting
those of Paris. Their displays are remarkable.
Their spaciousness impressed me
greatly. Even at a crowded time it was not difficult
to move about. In London, where our
shops are mostly cramped and old-fashioned, it
would be impossible for such large numbers of
people to find admittance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tribute is a very nice one. For a long
time the department stores have realized the difficulties
under which they labor and have been
making efforts to overcome them. They have
formed associations by which they study each
other's methods, and most of them have very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
highly organized systems of training and management.
One big department store carries on
courtesy drives. Talks are given, posters are
exhibited, and prizes are offered for the most
courteous clerks in the store. &ldquo;We know that
it is not fair to give prizes,&rdquo; the personnel manager
says, &ldquo;because it is impossible to tell really
which clerks are the most courteous, but it stimulates
interest and effort throughout the organization
and the effects last after the drive is
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One big department store which is favorably
known among a large client&egrave;le for courteous
handling of customers depends upon its atmosphere
to an enormous extent, but it realizes that
atmosphere does not come by chance, that it has
to be created. They have arranged it so that
each clerk has time to serve each customer who
enters without the nervous hurry which is the
cause of so much rudeness. The salesclerks who
come into the institution are given two weeks'
training in the mechanical end of their work, the
ways of recording sales, methods of approach,
and so on, as well as in the spirit of co&ouml;peration
and service. By the time the clerk is placed behind
the counter he or she can conduct a sale
courteously and with despatch, but there is never
a time when the head of the department is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
ready and willing to be consulted about extraordinary
situations which may arise.</p>

<p>It is during the rush seasons such as the three
or four weeks which precede Christmas that courtesy
is put to the severest test, and the store described
in the paragraph above bears up under
it nobly. It did not wait until Christmas to begin
teaching courtesy. It had tried to make it
a habit, but last year several weeks before the
holidays it issued a bulletin to its employees to
remind them of certain things that would make
the Christmas shopping less nerve-racking. The
first paragraph was headed <span class="smcap">HEALTH</span>. It ran as
follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to be really merry at Christmas
time, it will be well to bear in mind during
this busy month at least these few &lsquo;health
savers&rsquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every night try to get eight good hours of
sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All day try to keep an even temper and a
ready smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember that five minutes lost in the morning
means additional pressure all day long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to make your extra effort a steady one&mdash;not
allowing yourself to get excited and rushed
so that you make careless mistakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to eat regularly three good nourishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
meals, relaxing completely while you are at the
table and for a little while afterward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Breathe deeply, and as often as you can, good
fresh air&mdash;it cures weariness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don't forget that a brisk walk, a sensible
dinner, an hour's relaxation, and then a hot
bath before retiring, make a refreshing end for
one business day and a splendid preparation for
the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were six other paragraphs in the bulletin.
One asked the salesclerks to take the greatest
care in complying with a customer's request
to send gift purchases without the price tags.
Another asked them to pay strictest attention to
getting the right addresses, and most of the
others were taken up with suggestions for ways
to avoid congestion by using a bank of elevators
somewhat less conveniently located than the
others, by limiting their personal telephone calls
to those which were absolutely necessary, and so
on. In both tone and content the bulletin was
an excellent one. It first considered the employees
and then the customers. There was no
condescension in the way it was written and there
was no &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; about what was in it. But the
bulletin was only a small part of an effort that
never stops.</p>

<p>The purpose of the store is, to quote from its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
own statement, &ldquo;to render honest, prompt, courteous
and complete service to customers&rdquo; and the
qualities by which they measure their employees
are as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Qualities" width="60%">
<tr><td align='left'>Health</td><td align='left'>Accuracy</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Loyalty</td><td align='left'>Thoroughness</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Co&ouml;peration</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Initiative</td><td align='left'>Responsibility</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Industry</td><td align='left'>Knowledge</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Courtesy is not included in the list but it is
unnecessary. If these qualities are developed
courtesy will come of its own accord. It is
worth noting that health comes first in the list.
To a business man, or indeed to any other, it is
one of the most precious possessions in the world,
and is the best of backgrounds upon which to
embroider the flower of courtesy.</p>

<p>Every employer who has had any experience
knows the value of a contented workman, and
does what he can to make and keep him so by
paying him adequate wages, and providing comfortable,
sanitary, and pleasant working conditions.
Contentment is, however, more an attitude
of mind than a result of external circumstances.
Happiness is who, not where, you are.
We do not mean by this that a workman should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
be wholly satisfied and without ambition or that
he should face the world with a permanent grin,
but that he should to the best of his ability follow
that wonderful motto of Roosevelt's, &ldquo;Do
what you can where you are with what you have.&rdquo;
No man can control circumstances; not even the
braggart Napoleon, who declared that he made
circumstances, could control them to the end;
and no man can shape them to suit exactly his
own purposes, but every man can meet them
bravely as a gentleman should.</p>

<p>Most big business concerns supply rest rooms,
eating places, recreation camps, and all manner
of comforts for their employees, and most of
them maintain welfare departments. No business
house under heaven could take the place of
a home, but where the home influence is bad the
best counterfoil is a wholesome atmosphere in
which to work. Recently an institution advertising
for help, instead of asking what the applicant
could do for it, pictured and described what
it could do for the applicant. The result was
that they got a high-class group of people to
make their selection from, and their attitude was
one which invited the newcomers to do their best.</p>

<p>Factory owners are paying a good deal of attention
to the appearance of their buildings.
Many of them have moved out into the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
so as to provide more healthful surroundings for
work. Numbers of modern factory buildings
are very beautiful to look at, trim white buildings
set in close-cut lawns with tennis courts and
swimming pools not far away, red brick buildings
covered with ivy, sand-colored ones with
roses climbing over them, and others like the one
famous for its thousand windows, rather more
comfortable than lovely. In our big cities there
are office buildings that look like cathedrals, railroad
stations that look like temples, and traffic
bridges that look (from a distance) like fairy
arches leading into the land of dreams. They
are not all like this. We wish they were. But
it is to the credit of the American business man
that he has put at least a part of his life and work
into the building of beautiful things. The influence
which comes from them is, like nearly all
potent influences, an unconscious one, but it
makes for happiness and contentment.</p>

<p>The problem of keeping the employees contented
is somewhat different in every place.
House organs, picnics, dances, recreation parks,
sanitariums in the country and so on can be utilized
by &ldquo;big business,&rdquo; but the spirit which animates
them is the same as that which makes the
grocery man at Hicksville Centre give his delivery
boy an afternoon off when the baseball team<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
comes to town. The spirit of courtesy is everywhere
the same, but it must be kept in mind that
the end of business is production, production
takes work, and that play is introduced in order
that the work may be better. This is true
whether we are looking at the matter from the
point of view of the employer or of the employee.
What is to the interest of one&mdash;this is gaining
slow but sure recognition&mdash;is to the interest of
the other.</p>

<p>Certain kinds of mechanical work are very trying
because of their monotony. The work must
be done, however, and in well-ordered places it is
arranged so that the worker has brief periods of
rest at regular intervals or so that he is shifted
from one kind of activity to another. It is poor
economy to wear out men. In the old days before
the power of steam or electricity had been
discovered, boats were propelled by slaves who
were kept below decks chained to their seats, and
watched by an overseer who forced them to continue
rowing long after they had reached the
point of exhaustion. The galley slave sat always
on the same side of the boat and after a few
years his body became so twisted and warped
that he was no good for anything else, and pretty
soon was not even good for that. Then he was
thrown into the discard&mdash;most of them died be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>fore
they got this far along&mdash;and the owner of
the boat had to look out for more men. Something
like this happens to the soul of a man who
is bound to dreary, monotonous work without relief
or any outlet for growth. It is deadening to
him, to his work, and to his employer. The far-sighted
employer knows it. The masters of
slaves learned it many years ago. The chain
which binds the servant to the master binds the
master to the servant. And the fastening is as
secure at one end as it is at the other.</p>

<p>Too strict supervision&mdash;slave-driving&mdash;is fatal
to courtesy. The places which have intricate spy
systems to watch their employees are the ones
where there is most rudeness and trickery. The
clerk who is hectored, nagged, spied upon, suspected
and scolded by some hireling brought in
for that purpose or by the head of the firm himself
cannot be expected to give &ldquo;a smile with
every purchase and a thank you for every goodbye.&rdquo;
The training of employees never stops,
but it is something that should be placed very
largely in their own hands. After a certain point
supervision should be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Most places hate to discharge a man. Labor
turnover is too expensive. Most of them try to
place their men in the positions for which they
are best suited. It is easier to take a round peg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
out of a square hole and put it into a round one
than it is to send out for another assortment of
pegs. Men are transferred from sales departments
to accounting departments, are taken off
the road and brought into the home office, and are
shifted about in various ways until they fit. If
a man shows that &ldquo;he has it in him&rdquo; he is given
every chance to succeed. &ldquo;There is only one
thing we drop a man for right off,&rdquo; says an employment
manager in a place which has in its
service several thousand people of both sexes,
&ldquo;and that is for saying something out of the way
to one of our girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This same manager tells the story of a boy he
hired and put into a department which had been
so badly managed that there were a number of
loose ends to be tied up. The boy threw himself
into his work, cleared up things, and found himself
in a &ldquo;soft snap&rdquo; without a great deal to do.
He happened not to be the kind of person who
can be satisfied with a soft snap, and he became
so restive and unhappy that he was recommended
for discharge. This brought him back
to the head of the employment bureau. He, instead
of throwing the young man out, asked that
he be given a second trial in a department where
the loose ends could not be cleaned up. It
was a place where there was always plenty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
work to do, and the young man has been happy
and has been doing satisfactory work ever
since.</p>

<p>The house in which this happened is always
generous toward the mistakes of its employees
if the mistakes do not occur too persistently and
too frequently. In one instance a boy made
three successive errors in figures in as many days.
He was slated for discharge but sent first before
the employment manager. As they talked the
latter noticed that the boy leaned forward with
a strained expression on his face. Thinking perhaps
he was slightly deaf, he lowered his voice,
but the boy understood every word he said. Then
he noticed that there was a tiny red ridge across
his nose as if he were accustomed to wearing
glasses, although he did not have them on, and
when he asked about it he discovered that the
boy had broken his glasses a few days before,
and that he had not had them fixed because he
did not have money enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you tell us about it?&rdquo; the employment
manager asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not your fault that I broke them,&rdquo;
the boy replied. &ldquo;It was up to me,&rdquo; an independent
answer which in itself indicates how
much worth while it was to keep him.</p>

<p>The manager gave him money enough to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the glasses mended, the next day the boy was
back at work, and there was no more trouble.</p>

<p>An employee in the same organization unintentionally
did something which hurt the president
of the firm a great deal. But when he went to
him and apologized (it takes a man to admit
that he is wrong and apologize for it) the president
sent him back to his desk, &ldquo;It's all
right, boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know you care. That's
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a big department store in New England
there was a girl a few years back with an alert
mind, an assertive personality, and a tremendous
fund of energy. She was in the habit of giving
constructive suggestions to the heads of the departments
in which she worked, and because of
her youth and manner, they resented it. &ldquo;I
took her into my office,&rdquo; the manager said.
&ldquo;I'm the only one she can be impertinent to there
and I don't mind it. It is a bad manifestation
of a good quality, and in time the disagreeable
part of it will wear off. She will make an excellent
business woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a man finds fault with a boy without explaining
the cause to him,&rdquo; we are quoting here
from an executive in a highly successful Middle
Western firm, &ldquo;I won't fire the boy, I fire the
man. We have not a square inch of space in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
this organization for the man who criticizes a
subordinate without telling him how to do better.&rdquo;
Unless the plan of management is big
enough to include every one from the oldest saint
to the youngest sinner it is no good. Business
built on oppression and cut-throat competition,
whether the competition is between employer and
employee or between rival firms, is war, and war,
industrial or political, is still what General Sherman
called it some years ago.</p>

<p>We hold no brief for paternalism. We have
no patience with it. All that we want is a spirit
of fairness and co&ouml;peration which will give every
man a chance to make good on his own account.
This spirit inevitably flowers into courtesy. In
every place courtesy should be, of course, so
thoroughly a part of the surroundings that it is
accepted like air or sunshine without comment.
But it is not, and never has been except in old
civilizations where manners have ripened and
mellowed under the beneficent influence of time.
Our traditions here&mdash;speaking of the country as
a whole&mdash;are still in the making, but we have at
least got far enough along to realize that it is
not only worth while to do things that are good,
but, as an old author has it, to do them with a
good grace. It cannot be accomplished overnight.
Courtesy is not like a fungous growth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
springing up in a few hours in the decayed parts
of a tree; it is like that within the tree itself which
gives lustre to the leaves and a beautiful surface
to the whole. It takes time to develop it&mdash;time
and patience&mdash;but it is worth waiting for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<h3>PERSONALITY</h3>

<p>All that makes a man who he is and not
someone else is called personality. It is the sum
total of his qualities, a thing inborn, but including
besides such externals as dress, manner, and
appearance. It is either a tremendous asset or
a terrific liability, and so important that certain
schools which purport to teach success in business
declare that it is everything. Which is just
as foolish as saying that it is nothing.</p>

<p>One of these success-before-you-wake-to-morrow-morning
schools of business instruction dismisses
the fact which has remained true through
three thousand years of change, namely, that
there is no short cut to success, as a myth, and
even goes so far as to say that it is almost impossible
to achieve success to-day by working for it.
E. H. Harriman they give as an example of a
man who did no work but won success by smoking
cigars while other men built railroads for him,
quoting a joking remark of his to prove a serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
point, when, as a matter of fact, Mr. Harriman
was one of the large number of American business
men who have literally worked themselves to
death. Foch said that he won the war by smoking
his pipe, but does any one believe that the
great commander won the war by not working?
What he meant was that he won the war by
thinking, and the worn face, which seemed almost
twice as old when the conflict was over,
showed how hard that work was.</p>

<p>It is so impossible for a false doctrine to stand
on its own feet that the spread-eagle advertisement
of this school contradicts itself long before
it gets to the &ldquo;Sign here and mail to-day&rdquo; coupon.
&ldquo;The first time you try to swim,&rdquo; shouts
the advertisement, &ldquo;for instance, you sink; and
the first time you try to ride a bicycle you fall
off. But the ability to do these things was born
in you. And shortly you can both swim and
ride. Then you wonder why you could not always
do these things. They seem so absurdly
simple.&rdquo; It may be that there are people who
have learned to swim and to ride a bicycle by sitting
in a chair and cultivating certain inherent
qualities but we have never heard of them. Everybody
that we ever knew worked and worked
hard swimming and riding before they learned.
The only way to learn to do a job is to do it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the only way to succeed is to work. Any school
or any person who says that &ldquo;the most important
thing for you to do is not to work, but first to
find the short road to success. After that you
may safely work all you like&mdash;but as a matter of
fact, you won't have to work very hard,&rdquo; is a liar
and a menace to the country and to business.</p>

<p>But the value of personality is not to be under-estimated.
&ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; says Thackeray somewhere
in &ldquo;The Virginians,&rdquo; &ldquo;has written a letter
of credit upon some men's faces, which is honored
almost wherever presented. Harry Warrington's
[Harry Warrington was the hero who
brought about this observation] countenance
was so stamped in his youth. His eyes were so
bright, his cheeks so red and healthy, his look so
frank and open, that almost all who beheld him,
nay, even those who cheated him, trusted him.&rdquo;
It was the &ldquo;letter of credit&rdquo; stamped upon the
face of Roosevelt, pledge of the character which
lay behind it, which made him the idol of the
American people.</p>

<p>Personality is hard to analyze and harder still
to acquire. The usual advice given to one who
is trying to cultivate a pleasing manner and address
is &ldquo;Be natural,&rdquo; but this cannot be taken
too literally. Most of us find it perfectly natural
to be cross and disagreeable under trying cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>cumstances.
It would be natural for a man to
cry out profane words when a woman grinds
down on his corn but it would not be polite. It
was natural for Uriah Heep to wriggle like an
eel, but that did not make it any the less detestable.
It was natural, considering the past history
of Germany and the system under which he
was educated, for the Kaiser to want to be lord
of the world, but that did not make it any the less
horrible.</p>

<p>Another bromidic piece of advice is &ldquo;Be perfectly
frank and sincere.&rdquo; But this, too, has its
limits. Some people pride themselves on saying
exactly what they think. Usually they are brutal,
insensitive, wholly incapable of sympathetic
understanding of any one else, and cursed, besides,
with a colossal vanity. A man may determine
to tell nothing but the truth, but this does
not make it necessary for him to tell the whole
truth, especially when it will hurt the feelings or
the reputation of some one else. No man has a
right to impose his opinions and prejudices, his
sufferings and agonies, on other people. It is
the part of a coward to whine.</p>

<p>And yet a man must be himself, must be natural
and sincere. Roosevelt could no more have
adopted the academic manner of Wilson than
Wilson could have adopted the boyish manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of Roosevelt. Lincoln could no more have
adopted the courtly grace of Washington than
Washington could have adopted the rugged simplicity
of Lincoln. Nor would such transformations
be desirable even if they were possible. The
world would be a very dreary place if we were
all cut by the same pattern.</p>

<p>A number of years ago in an upstate town in
New York there was a shoe store which had been
built up by the engaging personality of the man
who owned it. He had worked his way up from
a tiny shoe shop in New Jersey where, as a boy,
he made shoes by hand before there were factories
for the purpose, and he had always kept in
close touch with the business even after he owned
a large establishment and had a number of men
working under him. He stayed in the shop,
greeted his customers as they came in, and many
times waited on them himself.</p>

<p>When he retired from active business he sold
out to a man exactly his opposite in temperament,
as good a man, so far as character went,
as himself, but very quiet and taciturn. A woman
who had always patronized the shop and
was a friend of them both came to him soon after
the transfer was made and said, &ldquo;Now, Mr. Tillis,
the reason this place has prospered so is on
account of the personality of Mr. Kilbourne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
His shoes are good but people can get good
shoes at other places. They come here because
of Mr. Kilbourne. They like him, and if you
are not careful they will stop coming now that he
is gone. You've got to smile and show them
you are glad to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tillis felt that the woman was telling the
truth. He decided that he would stay in the
shop and greet each customer with a gladsome
smile and make himself generally pleasant and
agreeable. The next day he was fitting a shoe on
a woman who was also an old customer and a
friend of both men. He was smiling in his best
manner and congratulating himself that he was
doing very well when the woman abruptly took
her foot off the stand. &ldquo;What are you laughing
at?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>Some years later he told Mr. Kilbourne about
it. &ldquo;I decided then that there was no use in me
trying to be you. You had been yourself, and I
made up my mind that I'd be myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that is, after all, the only rule that can
be given. Be yourself, but be very sure that it
is your best self.</p>

<p>It is personality which permits one man to do
a thing that another would be shot for. What
is charming in this man is disgusting in that.
What is a smile with one becomes a smirk with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
another. What makes one succeed will cause
another to fail. It is personality that opens the
doors of opportunity. It cannot, alone, keep
them open, but it is worth a good deal to get
inside.</p>

<p>We were interested to observe the methods
used by three young men who were looking for
jobs, not one of whom would probably have succeeded
if he had used the tactics of either of the
others.</p>

<p>The first wanted to talk with the biggest executive
in a large organization. He had fought his
way through the ranks until he had got as far as
the man's secretary. &ldquo;Mr. So-and-So does not
see people who want jobs,&rdquo; said that young lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want a job,&rdquo; he prevaricated mildly,
&ldquo;I want to talk to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl let him in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. So-and-So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't want a
job. I want advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His manner was so ingenuous and charming,
his earnestness so glowing, that the man at the
desk listened while he talked, and then talked a
while himself, and ended by giving the young
man the position (as well as the advice) that he
wanted. But if he had been less attractive personally
and the older man had been shrewd
enough to see through the ruse (or perhaps he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
did see through it but made the proper discount
for it) or had been opposed to trick methods, the
scheme might not have worked so well.</p>

<p>The most universal weakness of intellect lies
in the part of the brain which listens to flattery.
Very few people like compliments laid on with a
trowel, but no man can resist the honest admiration
of another if it seems sincere. And since it
is the sort of thing that one likes almost above all
else he often takes the false coin for the true.</p>

<p>The second young man met the rebuff so familiar
to young men looking for their first job,
&ldquo;We want men with experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's what everybody says,&rdquo; the boy answered,
&ldquo;but what I want to know is how we are
going to get that experience if you don't give us
a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older man sympathized, but had no place
for the other and told him so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you do if you were I?&rdquo; the
young man asked as he turned to leave. The
other grinned. &ldquo;Why, I'd work for a firm for
a week for nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and show them
that they could not get along without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy stopped. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let
me work for you a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older man had not expected this but he
gave the youngster a chance and he made good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>The third young man had reached the point of
desperation. He had been out of a job several
weeks. He had been trying to get one all that
time and had not succeeded. He walked into
the employment bureau of a certain concern and
said, &ldquo;I want a job. I want a good job. Not
some dinky little place filing letters or picking
up chips. If you've got an executive position
where there is plenty of work and plenty of responsibility,
I want it.&rdquo; They asked him a few
questions about what he had been doing and a
few more about what he thought he could do, and
ended by giving him a desk and an office.</p>

<p>It would be foolish to advise any one to follow
any of these plans. Each man must work out
his own method, all the better if it is an original
one. Most business men like a simple approach
without any flourishes. &ldquo;It is astonishing,&rdquo; says
one man whose income runs to six figures, &ldquo;how
many things one can get just by asking for
them.&rdquo; The best reporter in America says that
he has always found the direct method of approach
better than any other. None is infallible
but this has the highest percentage of success.</p>

<p>So far as personal appearance is concerned&mdash;and
this is one of the most important elements
in the fashioning of personality&mdash;the greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
variations are not due to intrinsic differences in
character, nor to differences of feature or form,
but to the use and disuse of the bathtub. More
sharp than the distinction between labor and
capital or between socialism and despotism is
that between the people who bathe daily and
those who go to the tub only on Saturday night
or less often. The people with whom personal
cleanliness is a habit find dirt, grime, and sweat
revolting. To them &ldquo;the great unwashed&rdquo; are
repulsive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you teach a man to bathe,&rdquo; says John
Leitch in his book on &ldquo;Industrial Democracy,&rdquo;
&ldquo;you do more than merely teach him to cleanse
his body. You introduce him to a new kind of
life and create in him a desire for better living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The month before he began his wonderful
work at Tuskegee, Booker Washington spent
visiting the Negro families in the part of Alabama
where he was to teach. &ldquo;One of the saddest
things I saw during the month of travel
which I have described,&rdquo; he writes in his autobiography,
&ldquo;was a young man, who had attended
some high school, sitting down in a one-room
cabin, with grease on his clothing, filth all around
him, and weeds in the yard and garden, engaged
in studying a French grammar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Farther on he writes, &ldquo;It has been interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>ing
to note the effect that the use of the tooth-brush
has had in bringing about a higher degree
of civilization among the students. With few
exceptions, I have noticed that, if we can get
a student to the point where, when the first or
second tooth-brush disappears, he of his own motion
buys another, I have not been disappointed
in the future of that individual. Absolute cleanliness
of the body has been insisted upon from
the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cleanliness is an attribute of civilization. We
find it amusing to read that three or four hundred
years ago bathing for pleasure was unknown,
that when soap was first invented it was
used only for washing clothes, and that even so
late as the Seventeenth Century an author compiling
a book of rules for the gentleman of that
day advises him to wash his hands every day and
his face almost as often! In the monasteries
bathing was permitted only to invalids and the
very old. Perfume was used copiously, and
filth and squalor abounded. This even in royal
circles. Among the common people conditions
were unspeakable.</p>

<p>To-day a gentleman bathes and shaves every
day. He keeps his hair brushed, his finger nails
immaculate (or as clean as the kind of work
which he does permits), his linen is always clean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and his shoes are polished. He is not over-fastidious
about his clothes, but he has respect
enough for himself as well as for the people
among whom he lives to want to present as agreeable
an appearance as possible. &ldquo;Dress,&rdquo; wrote
Lord Chesterfield to his son, &ldquo;is a very foolish
thing, and yet it is a very foolish thing for a man
not to be well-dressed, according to his rank and
way of life.... The difference in this case
between a man of sense and a fop is that the fop
values himself upon his dress; and the man of
sense laughs at it, and at the same time knows he
must not neglect it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a cheap device for a man to trick himself
out with lodge pins and fraternity symbols, rings,
and badges in the hope that they will open doors
for him. Highly ornamental jewelry of any
kind is inappropriate. Not many men can offset
a heavy gold watch chain stretched full length
across their bosoms, not many can live down a
turquoise ring set with pearls, and very few can
bear the handicap of a bright gold front tooth.
Artists, alone, may gratify their taste for velvet
jackets, Tam-o'-Shanters, and Windsor ties,
but the privilege is denied business men. Eccentricity
of dress usually indicates eccentricity
of temper, and we do not want temperamental
business men. It is hard enough to get along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
with authors and artists and musicians. The
business man who is wise wears conventional
clothes of substantial material in conservative
colors. Good sense and good taste demand it.</p>

<p>The time has passed when uncouthness of
dress and manner can be taken as a pledge of
honesty and good faith. The President of the
United States to-day is a well-dressed, well-groomed
man, and no one thinks any the less of
him for it. Men no longer regard creased trousers,
nicely tied cravats, well-chosen collars,
and harmonious color combinations as signs of
sissiness, snobbishness, or weak-mindedness.</p>

<p>Formal dinners and other ceremonious functions
require evening dress. It is the custom,
as the Orientals say; and for the sake of other
people present if not for his own, a man should
undergo the discomfort, if he finds it a discomfort,
and many men do, of conforming to it.
Holiday attire gives a happy note of festivity
which might otherwise be lacking. It is quite
possible to point to a number of men who have
succeeded in business who were wholly indifferent
to matters of dress. But it does not prove
anything. Men rise by their strength, not by
their weakness. Some men wait until after they
have become rich or famous to become negligent
of their personal appearance. But it is well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to remember that &ldquo;if Socrates and Aristippus
have done aught against custom or good manner,
let not a man think he can do the same: for they
obtained this license by their great and excellent
good parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A well-dressed man is so comfortably dressed
that he is not conscious of his clothes and so inconspicuously
dressed that no one else is conscious
of them.</p>

<p>In a good many instances it is not his own
dress which bothers a business man so much as
it is that of some one else&mdash;his stenographer, for
instance. Men do not have quite so much opportunity
to make themselves ridiculous as women.
Their conventions of dress are stricter,
and, as a rule, they can express their love of
color and ornamentation only in their choice of
ties and socks. Girls have practically no restrictions
except what happens to be the style at
the moment, and a young girl untrained in selecting
and combining colors and lines, and making
money for the first time in her life, is more
likely than not to make herself look more like a
Christmas tree than a lily of the field.</p>

<p>The big department stores which employ hundreds
of girls to meet and serve their customers
have settled the problem for themselves by requiring
the girls to wear uniforms. The uni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>form
is very simple; often a certain color during
working hours is prescribed, but the girls are
permitted to choose their own styles. Other
places have women who look after the welfare
of the girls and prevent them from laying themselves
open to misunderstanding by the way they
dress. Large organizations can afford to have
a special person to take care of such matters, but
in a small office the problem is different.</p>

<p>Of course, a man can always dismiss a girl
who dresses foolishly or carelessly, but this is
sneaking away from a problem instead of facing
it. High-class offices have comparatively
little trouble this way. In the first place, they
do not attract the frivolous, light-headed, or
&ldquo;tough&rdquo; girls; in the second place, if such girls
come, the atmosphere in which they work either
makes them conform to the standards of the office
or leave and go somewhere else. If a girl in
his office dresses in a way that he considers inappropriate,
a man may tactfully suggest that
something simpler would be more dignified and
more in keeping with business ideals and traditions.
But, oh, he must be careful! On no subject
is one so sensitive as on his personal appearance,
and women, perhaps, more so than men.</p>

<p>There is a limit to how far an employer should
go in dictating the manner of his employees'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
dress. When the head of a big Western department
store declared that he would discharge all
the girls who bobbed their hair, most of us felt
that he had gone a bit too far, even while we saw
the logic of his position. While it is the only
sensible way in the world for a woman to wear
her hair the majority of people have not yet
come to think so. To the average person, especially
to Mrs. Grundy, who is really the most
valuable customer a department store has, the
impression given by bobbed hair is one of frivolity
or eccentricity. The impression given the
customer as she enters a store is a most important
item; the head of the store knew it, and therefore
he placed the ban on bobbed hair. Whichever
side we take in this particular case this is
true: The business woman should give, like the
business man, an impression of dependability,
and she cannot do it if her appearance is abnormal,
or if her mind is divided between how she is
looking and what she is doing.</p>

<p>It is almost funny that we let the faults and
mannerisms of other people affect us to such an
extent. They are nothing to us, and yet a man
can work himself into a perfect frenzy of temper
merely by looking at or talking to another who
has a fidgety way of moving about, a dainty
manner of using his hands, or a general demean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>&mdash;or
that is delicate and ladylike. Men like what
the magazines call &ldquo;a red-blooded, two-fisted, he-man.&rdquo;
But the world is big enough to accommodate
us all whether the blood in our veins is
red or blue, and it is perfectly silly for a man to
throw himself into a rage over some harmless
creature who happens to exasperate him simply
because he is alive.</p>

<p>It is an altogether different matter when it is
a question of one man taking liberties with another.
Most people object to the physical nearness
of others. It is the thing that makes the
New York subways during the rush hours such
a horror. It is not pleasant to have a person so
near that his breath is against your face, and
there are not many men who enjoy being slapped
on the back, punched in the ribs, or held fast by
a buttonhole or a coat lapel. A safe rule is
never to touch another person. He may resent
it.</p>

<p>The garrulous or impertinent talker is almost
as objectionable as the hail-fellow-well-met, slap-on-the-back
fellow. Charles Dickens has a record
of this kind of American in the book which
he wrote after his visit in this country: &ldquo;Every
button in his clothes said, &lsquo;Eh, what's that? Did
you speak? Say that again, will you?&rsquo; He was
always wide awake, always restless; always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
thirsting for answers; perpetually seeking and
never finding....</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wore a fur great-coat at that time, and before
we were well clear of the wharf, he questioned
me concerning it, and its price, and where
I bought it, and when, and what fur it was, and
what it weighed, and what it cost. Then he
took notice of my watch, and asked me what <i>that</i>
cost, and whether it was a French watch, and
where I got it, and how I got it, and whether I
bought it or had it given me, and how it went and
where the keyhole was, and when I wound it,
every night or every morning, and whether I
ever forgot to wind it at all, and if I did, what
then? Where I had been to last, and where I
was going next, and where I was going after
that, and had I seen the President, and what did
he say, and what did I say, and what did he say
when I had said that? Eh? Lor' now! Do
tell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sort of curiosity is harmless enough, but
exasperating, and so childish that one hates to rebuke
the person who is asking the foolish questions.
There is another kind which is perhaps
worse&mdash;the man who asks intrusive questions
about how much salary another is getting, how
old he is (men are as sensitive on this subject as
women) and so on and on. It is perfectly le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>gitimate
to refuse to answer any question to
which one does not wish to reply. Every man
has a right to mental privacy even when he is denied,
as he is in so many modern offices, any other
kind of privacy.</p>

<p>A loud or boisterous person is objectionable.
Many times this is through carelessness, but
sometimes, as when a man recounts the story of
his dinner with Mr. Brown, who is a national figure,
in a voice so loud that all the people in the
car or room or whatever place he happens to be
in, can hear him, it is deliberate. The careless
person is the one who discusses personalities
aloud in elevators, on the train, and in all manner
of public places. Exchanging gossip is a pretty
low form of indoor sport and exchanging it aloud
so that everybody can hear makes it worse than
ever. Names should never be mentioned in a
conversation in a place where strangers can overhear,
especially if the connection is an unpleasant
one. Private opinions should never be aired
in public places (except from a platform).</p>

<p>The highly argumentative or aggressive person
is another common type of nuisance. He
usually raises his voice, thus drowning out the
possibility of interruption, and talks with so
much noise and so many vigorous gestures that
he seems to try to make up for his lack of intel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>lect
by an excess of tumult. Arguments have
never yet convinced anybody of the truth, and it
is a very unpleasant method to try. Most arguments
are about religion or politics and even if
they were settled nothing would be accomplished.
In the Middle Ages men used to debate about
the number of angels that could stand on the
point of a pin. Hours and hours were wasted
and learned scholars were brought into the discussion,
which was carried forward as seriously
as if it were a debate between the merits of the
Republican and Democratic parties. Suppose
they had settled it. Would it have mattered?</p>

<p>One of the most offensive public plagues is the
man who leaves a trail of untidiness behind him.
No book of etiquette, not even a book of business
etiquette, could counsel eating on the streets in
spite of the historic and inspiring example of Mr.
Benjamin Franklin walking down the streets of
Philadelphia with a loaf of bread under each arm
while he munched from a third which he held in
his hand. One can forgive a man, however, if
he, feeling the need of nourishment, eats a bar of
chocolate if he takes great care to put the wrappings
somewhere out of the way. No man with
any civic pride will scatter peanut hulls, cigarette
boxes, chocolate wrappings, raisin boxes,
and other debris along the streets, in the cars, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the stairs, and even on the floors of office buildings.
Garbage cans and waste-baskets were
made to take care of these things.</p>

<p>Tidiness is worth more to a business man than
most of them realize. In the first place it gives
a favorable impression to a person coming in
from the outside, and, in the second place, it
helps those on the inside to keep things straight.
Folders for correspondence, card indexes, memorandum
files and other similar devices are essential
to the orderly transaction of business.</p>

<p>Keeping ashes and scraps of paper off the
floor may seem trifles, but such trifles go far toward
making the atmosphere, which is another
word for personality, of an office. Some men
have secretaries who take care of their desks and
papers and supervise the janitor who cleans the
floors and windows, but those who do not, find
that they can manage better when they have a
place to put things and put them there.</p>

<p>Nothing has more to do with making a gentleman
than a courteous and considerate attitude
toward women. In business a man should show
practically the same deference toward a woman
that he does in society. Any man can be polite
to a woman he is anxious to please, the girl he
loves, for instance, but it takes a gentleman to be
polite to every woman, especially to those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
work for him, those over whom he exercises authority.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for a man to rise every time
one of the girls in his office enters his private
audience room, but he should always rise to receive
a visitor, whether it is a man or woman, and
should ask the visitor to be seated before he sits
down himself. In witheringly hot weather a
man may go without his coat even if his entire
office force consists of girls, but he should never
receive a guest in his shirt sleeves. He should
listen deferentially to what the visitor has to say,
but if she becomes too voluble or threatens to
stay too long or if there is other business waiting
for him, he may (if he can) cut short her conversation.
When she is ready to go he should rise
and conduct her to the door or to the elevator, as
the case may be, and ring the bell for her. He
cannot, of course, do this if his visitors are frequent,
if their calls are about matters of trifling
importance, or if he is working under high pressure.</p>

<p>We once had an English visitor here in America
who thought our manners were outrageously
bad, but there was one point on which we won a
perfect score. &ldquo;Any lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may travel
alone, from one end of the United States to the
other, and be certain of the most courteous and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
considerate treatment everywhere. Nor did I
ever once, on any occasion, anywhere, during my
rambles in America, see a woman exposed to the
slightest act of rudeness, incivility, or even inattention.&rdquo;
Conditions have changed since then.
Women had not left their homes to go into
offices and factories, but unless we can hold to
the standard described by the Englishman, the
change has not been for the better, for any of the
people concerned.</p>

<p>Since the Victorian era our ideas of what constitutes
an act of rudeness have been modified.
Then it would have been unthinkable that a woman
should remain standing in a coach while men
were seated. Now it is possible for a man to
keep his place while a woman swings from a
strap and defend himself on the grounds that he
has worked harder during the day than she (how
he knows is more than we can say), and that he
has just as much right (which is certainly true)
as any one else. Yet it is a gracious and a chivalrous
act for a man to offer a woman his place
on a car, and it is very gratifying to see that hundreds
of them, even in the cities, where life goes
at its swiftest pace and people live always in a
hurry, surrender their seats in favor of the women
who, like themselves, are going to work.
Old people, afflicted people, men and women who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
are carrying children in their arms, and other
people who obviously need to sit down are nearly
always given precedence over the rest of us.
This is, of course, as it should be.</p>

<p>But the heart of what constitutes courtesy has
not changed and never will. It is exactly what
it was on that day nearly four hundred years ago
when Sir Philip Sidney, mortally wounded on
the field of Zutphen, gave his last drop of water
to the dying soldier who lay near him and said,
&ldquo;Thy need is greater than mine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>TABLE MANNERS</h3>

<p>In the old books of etiquette in the chapter
on table manners the authors used to state that
it was not polite to butter your bread with your
thumb, to rub your greasy fingers on the bread
you were about to eat, or to rise from the table
with a toothpick in your mouth like a bird that
is about to build her nest. We have never seen
any one butter his bread with his thumb, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There are in the United States nearly five million
people who can neither read nor write. We
have no statistics but we venture to say there are
as many who eat with their knives. There are
people among us&mdash;and they are not all immigrants
in the slum districts or Negroes in the
poorer sections of the South&mdash;who do not know
what a napkin is, who think the proper way to
eat an egg is to hold it in the hand like a piece of
candy, and bite it, the egg having previously
been fried on both sides until it is as stiff and as
hard as a piece of bristol board, who would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
recognize a salad if they saw one, and who have
never heard of after-dinner coffee.</p>

<p>Very few of them are people of wealth, but an
astonishing number of successful business men
were born into such conditions. They had no
training in how to handle a knife and fork and
they probably never read a book of etiquette, but
they had one faculty, which is highly developed
in nearly every person who lifts himself above
the crowd, and that is observation.</p>

<p>In addition to this a young man is very fortunate,
especially if his way of life is cast among
people whose manners are different from those
to which he has been accustomed, if he has a
friend whom he can consult, not only about table
manners but about matters of graver import as
well. And he should not be embarrassed to ask
questions. The disgrace, if disgrace it could be
called, lies only in ignorance.</p>

<p>A number of years ago a young man who was
the prospective heir to a fortune&mdash;this charming
story is in Charles Dickens's wonderful novel,
&ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo;&mdash;went up to London for
the express purpose of learning to be a gentleman.
It fell about that almost as soon as he arrived
he was thrown into the company of a delightful
youth who had already attained the minor
graces of polite society. Very much in earn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>est
about what he had set out to do, and blessed
besides with a goodish bit of common sense, he
explained his situation to Herbert, for that was
the other boy's name, mentioned the fact that he
had been brought up by a blacksmith in a country
place, that he knew practically nothing of the
ways of politeness, and that he would take it as
a great kindness if Herbert would give him a
hint whenever he saw him at a loss or going
wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With pleasure,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;though I venture
to prophesy that you'll want very few hints.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went in to dinner together, a regular
feast of a dinner it seemed to the ex-blacksmith's
apprentice, and after a while began to talk about
the benefactress who, they believed, had made it
possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me introduce the topic,&rsquo; began Herbert,
who had been watching Pip's table manners
for some little time, &lsquo;by mentioning that in London
it is not the custom to put the knife in the
mouth&mdash;for fear of accidents&mdash;and that while
the fork is reserved for that use it is not put further
in than necessary. It is scarcely worth mentioning,
only it's as well to do as other people do.
Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand
but under. This has two advantages. You get
at your mouth better (which after all is the ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ject),
and you save a good deal of the attitude
of opening oysters on the part of the right elbow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He offered these suggestions (said Pip) in
such a lively way, that we both laughed and I
scarcely blushed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation and the dinner continued
and the friendship grew apace. Presently Herbert
broke off to observe that &ldquo;society as a body
does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious
in emptying one's glass, as to turn it bottom upwards
with the rim on one's nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had been doing this,&rdquo; Pip confessed, &ldquo;in an
excess of attention to his recital. I thanked him,
and apologized. He said, &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; and resumed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was written many years ago but neither
in life nor in literature is there a more beautiful
example of perfect courtesy than that given by
Herbert Pocket when he took the blacksmith's
boy in hand and began his education in the art of
being a gentleman. Not only was he at perfect
ease himself but&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;he
put the blacksmith's boy at ease.</p>

<p>It is worth remarking, by way of parenthesis,
that Herbert's father was a gentleman. &ldquo;It is
a principle of his,&rdquo; declared the boy, &ldquo;that no
man who was not a true gentleman at heart, ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was, since the world began, a true gentleman in
manner. He says, no varnish can hide the grain
of the wood; and that the more varnish you put
on, the more the grain will express itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The American table service is not complicated.
Any intelligent person who knows the
points covered by Herbert Pocket, who knows
that one should not cut up all of his meat at the
same time but mouthful by mouthful as he needs
it, that it is not customary to butter a whole slice
of bread at once nor to plaster cheese over the entire
upper surface of a cracker, can by a dint of
watching how other people do it find his way
without embarrassment through even the most
elaborate array of table implements. The easiest
way to acquire good table manners (or good
manners of any other kind, as far as that goes)
is to form the habit of observing how the people
who manage these things most gracefully go
about it. It is best to begin early. To use one
of David Harum's expressive maxims, &ldquo;Ev'ry
hoss c'n do a thing better 'n' spryer if he's ben
broke to it as a colt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eating should be, and, as a matter of fact, is,
when one follows his usual custom, an unconscious
process like the mechanical part of reading
or writing. It is only when he is trying to be
a bit more formal or fastidious than is habitual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
with him that a man gets tangled, so to speak, in
the tines of his fork.</p>

<p>Cooking is one of the fine arts. Poets, painters,
sculptors, musicians, and millionaires have always
paid tribute to it as such&mdash;and so is dining.
Like a great many other arts it was first developed
among royal circles, and there was a time
when the king resented the idea of a commoner
being able to dine with grace and elegance. Since
then it has become democratized, and now there
are no restrictions except those which a man
places about himself. And there is no earthly
(or heavenly) reason why a man should not eat
in the way which society has established as correct,
and a good many reasons why he should.</p>

<p>Physicians&mdash;and this is the strongest argument
we know&mdash;might advance their plea on the
grounds of good health. In this case we find,
as we do in a number of others, that what good
manners declares should be done is heartily endorsed
at the same time by good sense. It is
only among people of blunted sensibilities that
nice table manners count for nothing; for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's no reproach among swine, d'you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For being a bit of a swine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among business men it is often perplexing to
know whom and when to invite. Generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
speaking, the older man or the man with the superior
position takes the initiative, but there are
an infinite number of exceptions. Generally
speaking, also, the man who is resident in a place
entertains the one who is visiting, but there are
infinite exceptions to this as well, especially in
the case of traveling salesman. All courtesy is
mutual, and it is almost obligatory upon the
salesman who has been entertained to return the
courtesy in kind. Such invitations should be
tendered after a transaction is completed rather
than before. The burden of table courtesy falls
upon the man who is selling rather than the one
who is buying, probably because he is the one
to whom the obvious profit accrues.</p>

<p>Social affairs among the wives of business
men which grow out of the business relations of
their husbands follow the same rules as almost
any other social affairs. Nearly always it is the
wife of the man with the higher position who issues
the first invitation, and it is permissible for
her to invite a woman whom she does not know
personally if she is the wife of a business friend
of her husband.</p>

<p>The biggest hindrance to the establishment of
good manners among business men is the everlasting
hurry in which they (and all the rest of
us) live. There must first of all be leisure, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
perhaps to the extent advocated by a delightful
literary gentleman of having three hours for
lunch every day, but time enough to sit down and
relax. Thousands of business men dash out to
lunch&mdash;bad manners are at their worst in the
middle of the day&mdash;as if they were stopping off
at a railroad junction with twenty minutes to
catch a train and had used ten of them checking
baggage. And they do not always do it because
they are in a hurry. They have so thoroughly
developed the habit of living in a frenzied rush
that even when they have time to spare they cannot
slow down.</p>

<p>Pleasant surroundings are desirable. It is
much easier to dine in a quiet spacious room
where the linen is white and the china is thin, the
silver is genuine silver, and the service is irreproachable,
than in a crowded restaurant where
thick dishes rattle down on white-tiled tables
from the steaming arms of the flurried waitress,
where there is no linen, but only flimsy paper
napkins (which either go fluttering to the floor
or else form themselves into damp wads on the
table), where the patrons eat ravenously and untidily,
and where the atmosphere is dense with
the fumes of soup and cigarettes. But luxury in
eating is expensive and most of us must, perforce,
go to the white-tiled places. And the art of din<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>ing
is not a question of what one has to eat&mdash;it
may be beans or truffles&mdash;or where one eats it&mdash;from
a tin bucket or a mahogany table&mdash;it all
depends upon <i>how</i>; and the man who can eat in
a &ldquo;hash-house,&rdquo; an &ldquo;arm-chair joint,&rdquo; a &ldquo;beanerie,&rdquo;
a cafeteria, a three-minute doughnut
stand or any of the other quick-lunch places in as
mannerly a way as if he were dining in a hotel
<i>de luxe</i> has, we think, a pretty fair claim to the
title of gentleman.</p>

<p>The responsibility for a dinner lies with the
host. If his guest has had the same social training
that he has or is accustomed to better things
he will have comparatively little trouble. All he
can do is to give him the best within his means
<i>without apology</i>. We like to present ourselves
in the best possible light (it is only human) and
for this reason often carry our friends to places
we cannot afford. This imposes upon them the
necessity of returning the dinner in kind, and
the vicious circle swings around, each person in
it grinding his teeth with rage but not able to
find his way out. Entertaining is all right so
long as it is a useful adjunct to business, but
when it becomes a burden in itself it is time to
call a halt.</p>

<p>Smoking during and immediately after a meal
is very pleasing to the man who likes tobacco, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
if he has a guest (man or woman) who objects to
the smell of it he must wait until later. On the
other hand if his guest likes to smoke and he does
not he should insist upon his doing so. It is
a trifling thing but politeness consists largely
of yielding gracefully in trifles.</p>

<p>Old-fashioned gentlemen held it discourteous
to mention money at table, but in this degenerate
age no subject is taboo except those that
would be taboo in any decent society. Obviously
when men meet to talk over business they
cannot leave money out of the discussion. In a
number of firms the executives have lunch together,
meeting in a group for perhaps the only
time during the day. It helps immeasurably to
co&ouml;rdinate effort, but it sometimes fails to make
the lunch hour the restful break in the middle of
the day which it should be. It is generally much
more fun and of much more benefit to swap fish
stories and hunting yarns than to go over the details
of the work in the publicity department or
to formulate the plans for handling the Smith
and Smith proposition. Momentous questions
should be thrust aside until later, and the talk
should be&mdash;well, <i>talk</i>, not arguing, quarreling,
or scandal-mongering. The subject does not
greatly matter except that it should be something
in which all of the people at the table are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
interested. Whistler was once asked what he
would do if he were out at dinner and the conversation
turned to the Mexican War, and some one
asked him the date of a certain battle. &ldquo;Do?&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;Why, I would refuse to associate
with people who could talk of such things at
dinner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polite society has always placed a high value
on table manners, but it is only recently that they
have come to play so large a part in business.
Some one has said that you cannot mix business
and friendship. It would be nearer the truth
to say that you cannot separate them. More
and more it is becoming the habit to transact affairs
over the table, and a very pleasant thing it
is, too. Aside from the coziness and warmth
which comes from breaking bread together one is
free from the interruptions and noise of the office,
and many a commercial acquaintance has
ripened into a friend and many a business connection
has been cemented into something
stronger through the genial influence of something
good to eat and drink. It is, of course, a
mistake to depend too much upon one's social
gifts. They are very pleasant and helpful but
the work of the world is done in offices, not on
golf links or in dining rooms. We have little
patience with the man who sets his nose to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
grindstone and does not take it away until death
comes in between, but we have just as little with
the man who has never touched the grindstone.</p>

<p>Stories go the rounds of executives who choose
their subordinates by asking them out to lunch
and watching the way they eat. One man always
calls for celery and judges his applicant by
what he does with it. If he eats only the tender
parts the executive decides that he is extravagant,
at least with other people's money, but if
he eats the whole stalk, green leaves and all, he
feels sure that he has before him a man of economy,
common sense, and good judgment! The
story does not say what happens when the young
man refuses celery altogether. Another uses
cherry pie as his standard and judges the young
man by what he does with the pits. There are
three ways to dispose of them. They may be
lowered from the mouth with the spoon, they
may be allowed to drop unaided, or they may be
swallowed. The last course is not recommended.
The first is the only one that will land a job.
But tests like this work both ways and one is
rather inclined to congratulate the young men
who were turned down than those who were accepted.</p>

<p>All this aside, an employer does want to know
something about the table manners of an em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>ployee
who is to meet and dine with his customers.
An excellent salesman may be able to convince
a man of good breeding and wide social
training if he tucks his napkin into his bosom,
drinks his soup with a noise, and eats his
meat with his knife, but the chances are against
it.</p>

<p>A man who is interested heart and soul in one
thing will think in terms of it, will have it constantly
in his mind and on the tip of his tongue.
But the man of one subject, whatever that subject
may be, is a bore. It is right that a man
should live in his work, but he must also live outside
of it. One of the most tragic chapters in
the history of American life is the one which
tells of the millions and millions of men who became
so immersed in business affairs that they
lost sight of everything else. The four walls
of the narrow house which in the end closes
around us all could not more completely have
cut them off from the light of day. It is a long
procession and it has not ended&mdash;that line of
men passing single file like convicts down the
long gray vaults of business, business, business,
with never a thought for the stars or the moon
or books or trees or flowers or music or life or
love&mdash;nothing but what casts a shadow over
that dismal corridor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h3>TELEPHONES AND FRONT DOORS</h3>

<p>&ldquo;If the outside of a place is not all right,&rdquo;
says a man who spends the greater part of his
time visiting business houses and talking with
business men, &ldquo;the chances are that it is not
worth while to go inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are three ways of getting inside: by
letter (which has a chapter to itself), by the
front door, and by telephone. And there are
more complaints against the telephone way than
either or both the others, which is perfectly
natural, since it is the most difficult to manage.
In the first place, it requires good behavior from
three people at the same time, and that is a
good deal to expect. Secondly, they cannot see
one another&mdash;they are like blind people talking
together&mdash;and no one of them can do his
part unless the other two do theirs. In the
third place, the instrument is a lifeless thing,
and when something goes wrong with it it rouses
the helpless fury inspired by all inanimate ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>jects
which interfere with our comfort&mdash;like
intermittent alarm clocks, collar buttons that
roll under the furniture, and flivvers that go
dead without reason in the middle of country
roads. In each case whatever one does has no
effect. The alarm clock continues to ring (unless
one gets out of bed to shut it off, which is
worse than letting it ring), the collar button remains
hid in the darkest part of the room, the
flivver remains stuck in the muddiest part of the
road, and the telephone is worst of all, for the
source of the trouble is usually several miles
away and there is no means of getting at it.</p>

<p>The telephone is a nuisance&mdash;no one denies
it&mdash;but it is a necessity also&mdash;no one denies that,
either&mdash;and one of the greatest conveniences
in an age of great conveniences. Some of the
disagreeable features connected with it cannot
be done away with but must be accepted with as
much tranquility as we can master, like the terrific
noise which an a&euml;roplane makes or the trail of
smoke and cinders which a railway train leaves
behind. The one who is calling, for instance,
cannot know that he is the tenth or eleventh
person who has called the man at the other end
of the wire in rapid succession, that his desk
is piled high with correspondence which must
be looked over, signed, and sent out before noon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that the advertising department is waiting for
him to O. K. their plans for a campaign which
should have been launched the week before, that
an important visitor is sitting in the library growing
more impatient every minute, and that his
temper has been filed down to the quick by an
assortment of petty worries. (Of course, no office
should be run like this, but it sometimes happens
in the best of them.)</p>

<p>Some one has said that we are all like islands
shouting at each other across a sea of misunderstanding,
and this was long before telephones
were thought of. It is hard enough to make
other people understand what we mean, even
with the help of facial expression and gestures,
and over the wire the difficulty is increased a
hundred fold. For telephoning rests upon a
delicate adjustment between human beings by
means of a mechanical apparatus, and it takes
clear thinking, patience, and courtesy to bring
it about.</p>

<p>The telephone company began its career some
few years ago unhampered by the traditions to
which the earlier corporations were slave, the
old &ldquo;public be damned&rdquo; idea. Their arbitrary
methods had brought them to grief, and the new
concern, with a commendable regard for the lessons
taught by the experience of others, inaugu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>rated
a policy of usefulness, service, and courtesy.
The inside history of the telephone is one of
constant watchfulness, careful management, and
continuous improvement; and every improvement
has meant better service to the public.
(We are not trying to advertise the telephone
company. We realize that it has been guilty,
like every other business, of manifold sins.)</p>

<p>Even the fact that there is a telephone girl instead
of a telephone boy is due to the alertness
and good business sense of the company. To
put a boy before a switchboard and expect him
not to pull it apart to see how it was made; or
to place him in a position to entertain himself
by connecting the wrong parties and listening
to the impolite names they called each other
and expect him not to do it, would be expecting
the laws of nature to reverse themselves. The
telephone company tried it&mdash;for a while. They
discovered, besides, that a boy will not &ldquo;take&rdquo;
what a girl will. It makes no difference what
goes wrong with a connection, the subscriber
blames the operator when many times the operator,
especially the one he is talking to, has had
nothing to do with it. The girls have learned
to hold their tempers (not always, but most of
the time), but when boys had charge of the
switchboards and the man at the end of the wire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
yelled, &ldquo;You cut me off!&rdquo; and the youngster
had not, he denied it hotly: &ldquo;You're a liar! I
didn't!&rdquo; The subscriber would not stand for
this, angry words flew back and forth, and more
than once the indignant young operator located
the subscriber (not a very difficult thing for him
to do) and went around to settle things in person.
Words were not always the only weapons
used.</p>

<p>If this had continued the telephone would
never have become a public utility. People would
have looked upon it as an ingenious device but
not of universal practical value. As it is, good
salesmanship and efficient service first elevated
a plaything to a luxury and then reduced the
luxury to a necessity. And it was possible not
only because the mechanism itself is a miraculous
thing but because it has had back of it an intelligent
human organization working together
as a unit.</p>

<p>We say this deliberately, knowing that the
reader will think of the times when the trouble
he has had in getting the number he wanted has
made him think there was not a thimbleful of
intelligence among all of the people associated
with the entire telephone company. But considering
the body of employees as a whole the
standard of courteous and competent service is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
extraordinarily high. The public is impatient
and prone to remember bad connections instead
of good ones. It is ignorant also and has very
small conception of what a girl at central is
doing. And it is quick to blame her for faults
of its own.</p>

<p>One of the worst features of telephone service
is the fact that when one is angry or exasperated
he seldom quarrels with the right person.
Some time ago a man was waked in the middle of
the night by the ringing of the telephone bell.
He got out of bed to answer it and discovered
that the man was trying to get another number.
He went back to bed and to sleep. The telephone
bell rang again, and again he got out of
bed to answer it. It was the same man trying
to get the same number. He went to bed and
back to sleep. The telephone bell rang the third
time, he got out of bed again and answered it
again and found that it was still the same man
trying to get the same number! &ldquo;I wasn't very
polite the third time,&rdquo; he confessed when he told
about it. But the poor fellow at the other end
of the wire probably had just as touching a story
to tell, for unless it had been very important for
him to get the number he would hardly have
been so persistent. The girl at the switchboard
may have had a story of her own, but what it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
was is one of those things which, as Lord Dundreary
used to say, nobody can find out.</p>

<p>The girls who enter the service of the New
York Telephone Company (and the same thing
is true in the other branches of the telephone service,
especially in big cities where there are large
groups to work with) are carefully selected by
an employment bureau and sent to a school
where they are thoroughly grounded in the mechanical
part of their work and the ideals for
which the company stands. They are not placed
on a regular switchboard until they have proved
themselves efficient on the dummy switchboard,
and then it is with instructions to be courteous
though the heavens fall (though they do not express
it exactly that way). &ldquo;It is the best place
in the world to learn self-control,&rdquo; one of the
operators declares, and any one who has ever
watched them at work will add, &ldquo;Concentration,
also.&rdquo; One of the most remarkable sights in
New York is a central exchange where a hundred
or more girls are working at lightning
speed, undisturbed by the low murmur around
them, intent only on the switchboard in front of
them, making something like five hundred connections
a minute.</p>

<p>They are a wonderfully level-headed group,
these telephone girls, wonderfully unlike their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
clinging-vine Victorian grandmothers. They
do not know how to cling. If a man telephones
that he has been shot, the girl who receives the
call does not faint. She sends him a doctor instead
and takes the next call almost without the
loss of a second. If a woman wants a policeman
to get some burglars out of the house, she
sends her one; if some one telephones that a
house is burning, she calls out the fire department&mdash;and
goes straight on with her work.
Now and then something spectacular happens
to bring the splendid courage of the girls at the
switchboards to the attention of the public, such
as the magnificent service they gave from the exchange
located a few feet from Wall Street on
the day of the explosion, but ordinarily it passes,
like most of the other good things in life, without
comment.</p>

<p>The New York Telephone Company tries
to keep its girls healthy and happy. At regular
intervals they are given rest periods. Attractive
rooms are prepared for them, tastefully
furnished, well-lighted, and filled with comfortable
chairs, good books, and magazines. Substantial
meals are supplied in the middle of the
day at a nominal charge. Special entertainments
are planned from time to time, and best
of all, the play time is kept absolutely distinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
from the work time, a condition which makes
for happiness as well as usefulness.</p>

<p>The girls are not perfect, they are not infallible.
And they are only a third part of a telephone
call. They work under difficulties at a
task which is not an easy one, and their efficiency
does not rest with them alone but with the
people whom they serve as well.</p>

<p>A telephone call begins with the subscriber.
Very few people understand the intricate system
of cable and dynamos, vacuum tubes, coil
racks, storage batteries, transmitters and generators
which enable them to talk from a distance,
and a good many could not understand them
even if they were explained. Fortunately it
is not necessary that they should. The subscriber's
part is very simple.</p>

<p>He should first make sure that he is calling
the right number. In New York City alone,
forty-eight thousand wrong numbers are asked
for every day by subscribers who have not consulted
the telephone directory first, or who have
unconsciously transposed the digits in a number.
For example, a number such as 6454 can easily
be changed to 6544. The telephone directory is a
safe guide, much more so than an old letter or bill
head or an uncertain memory. Information may
be called if the number is not in the directory, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
one should be definite even with her. She cannot
supply the number of Mr. What-you-may-call-it
or of Mr. Thing-um-a-bob or of Mr. Smith
who lives down near the railroad station, and she
cannot give the telephone number of a house
which has no telephone in it. She has no right
to answer irrelevant questions; is, in fact, prohibited
from doing so. Her business is to furnish
numbers and she cannot do it efficiently if
she is expected also to explain why a cat has
whiskers, how to preserve string beans by drying
them, what time it is, what time the train leaves
for Wakefield, or what kind of connection can be
made at Jones's Junction.</p>

<p>In calling a number the name of the exchange
should be given first. The number itself should
be called with a slight pause between the hundreds
and the tens, thus, &ldquo;Watkins&mdash;pause&mdash;five,
nine&mdash;pause&mdash;hundred&rdquo; for &ldquo;Watkins
5900&rdquo; or &ldquo;Murray Hill&mdash;pause&mdash;four, two&mdash;pause&mdash;six,
three&rdquo; for &ldquo;Murray Hill 4263.&rdquo;
The reason for this is that the switchboard before
which the operator sits is honeycombed
with tiny holes arranged in sections of one hundred
each. Each section is numbered and
each of the holes within it is the termination
of a subscriber's line. In locating &ldquo;Watkins
5900&rdquo; the girl first finds the section labelled &ldquo;59<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>&rdquo;
and then the &ldquo;00&rdquo; hole in that section, and if
the &ldquo;59&rdquo; is given first she has found it by the
time the subscriber has finished calling the number.</p>

<p>The number should be pronounced slowly and
distinctly.</p>

<p>When the operator repeats it the subscriber
should acknowledge it, and if she repeats it incorrectly,
should stop her and give her the number
again. And he should always remember, however
difficult it may be to make her understand,
that he is talking to a girl, a human being, and
that the chances are ten to one that the poor
connection is not her fault.</p>

<p>To recall the operator in case the wrong person
is connected it is only necessary to move the
receiver hook slowly up and down. She may
not be able to attend to the recall at once but
jiggling the hook angrily up and down will not
get her any sooner. In fact, the more furious
the subscriber becomes the less the girl knows
about it, for the tiny signal light fails to register
except when the hook is moved slowly; or if the
switchboard is one where the operator is signalled
by a little disk which falls over a blank
space the disk fails to move down but remains
quivering almost imperceptibly in its usual position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>After he has placed a call a man should wait
at the telephone or near it until the connection
is made. Too many men have a way of giving
their secretaries a number to send through and
then wandering off somewhere out of sight so
that when the person is finally connected he has
to wait several minutes while the secretary locates
the man who started the call. It is the
acme of discourtesy to keep any one waiting in
this manner. It implies that your time is much
more valuable than his, which may be true, but
it is hardly gracious to shout it in so brazen a
fashion.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that in New York City
alone, more than a full business year is lost over
the telephone every day between sunrise and
sunset. There are 3,800,000 completed connections
made every day. Out of each hundred, six
show a delay of a minute or more before the person
called answers. In each day this amounts to
a delay of 228,000 connections. Two hundred
and twenty-eight thousand minutes (and sometimes
the delay amounts to much more than a
minute) is the equivalent of 475 days of eight
hours each, or as the gentleman who compiled
these interesting statistics has it, a business year
and a third with all the Sundays and holidays intact.
In the course of a year it amounts to more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
than all the business days that have elapsed
since Columbus discovered America!</p>

<p>It may be argued that we would be better off
if we lost more than a year every day and did all
our work at more leisurely pace. This may be,
but the time to rest is not when the telephone bell
is ringing.</p>

<p>The telephone on a business man's desk should
always be facing him and it should not be tricked
out with any of the patent devices except those
sanctioned by the company. Most of them lessen
instead of increase efficiency. A woman
in her home where calls are infrequent may hide
her telephone behind a lacquered screen or cover
it with pink taffeta ruffles, but in a business office
it is best to make no attempts to beautify it.
It is when it is unadorned that the ugly little
instrument gives its best service.</p>

<p>There should always be a pad and pencil at
hand so that the message (if there is one) can
be taken down without delay. The person at
the other end probably has not time (and certainly
has not inclination) to wait until you have
fumbled through the papers on your desk and
the rubbish in the drawers to locate something
to write on and something to write with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; is a useless and obsolescent form of
response in business offices. The name of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
firm, of the department, or of the man himself, or
of all three, according to circumstances, should be
given. When there is a private operator to take
care of the calls she answers with the name of
the firm, Blank and Blank. If the person at
the other end of the wire says, &ldquo;I want the Advertising
department,&rdquo; she connects them and
the man there answers with &ldquo;Advertising department.&rdquo;
The other then may ask for the manager,
in which case the manager answers with his
name. It is easy to grow impatient under all
these relays, but a complicated connection involving
half a dozen people before the right one
is reached can be accomplished in less than a
minute if each person sends it straight through
without stopping to exchange a number of &ldquo;Helloes&rdquo;
like a group of Swiss yodelers, or to ask
a lot of unnecessary questions.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to scream over the telephone.
The mouth should be held close to the
transmitter and the words should be spoken
carefully. In an open office where there are
no partitions between the desks one should take
especial pains to keep his voice modulated. One
person angrily spluttering over the telephone
can paralyze the work of all the people within
a radius of fifty feet. If it were a necessary evil
we could make ourselves grow accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
it. But it is not. And there is already enough
unavoidable wear and tear during the course of
a business day without adding this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Hello, what do you want?</i>&rdquo; is no way to
answer a call. No decent person would speak
even to a beggar at his door in this way and the
visitor over the telephone, whoever he is, is entitled
to a cordial greeting. <i>The voice with the
smile wins.</i></p>

<p>An amusing story is told of a man in Washington
who was waked one evening about eleven
o'clock by the telephone bell. At first he swore
that he would not answer it but his wife insisted
that it might be something very important, and
finally, outraged and angry, he blundered
through the dark across the room and into the
hall, jerked down the receiver and yelled,
&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; His wife, who was listening tensely
for whatever ill news might be forthcoming, was
perfectly amazed to hear him saying in the next
breath, in the most dulcet tones he had ever used,
&ldquo;Oh, how do you do, I'm <i>so</i> glad you called.
Oh, delightful. Charmed. I'm sure she will
be, too. Thank you. Yes, indeed. So good
of you. <i>Good</i>-bye.&rdquo; It was the wife of the
President of the United States asking him and
his wife to dinner at the White House.</p>

<p>If the person calling is given the wrong de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>partment
he should be courteously transferred to
the right one. Courteously, and not with a
brusque, &ldquo;You've got the wrong party&rdquo; or &ldquo;I'm
not the man you want&rdquo; but with &ldquo;Just a minute,
please, and I'll give you Mr. Miller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The time when people are rudest over the telephone
is when some one breaks in on the wire.
It might be just as well to remember that people
do not interrupt intentionally, and the intruder is
probably as disconcerted as the man he has interrupted.
If he had inadvertently opened the
wrong door in a business office the man inside
would not have yelled, &ldquo;Get out of here,&rdquo; but
over the telephone he will shriek, &ldquo;Get off the
wire&rdquo; in a tone he would hardly use to drive the
cow out of a cabbage patch.</p>

<p>In an effort to secure better manners among
their subscribers the telephone company has
asked them to try to visualize the person at the
other end of the wire and to imagine that they
are talking face to face. Many times a man
will say things over the telephone&mdash;rude, profane,
angry, insulting things, which he would not
dream of saying if he were actually before the
man he is talking to. And to make it worse he
is often so angry that he does not give the other
a chance to explain his side of it, at least not until
he has said all that he has to say, and even then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
he not infrequently slams the receiver down on
the hook as soon as he has finished!</p>

<p>Listening on a wire passes over from the field
of courtesy into that of ethics. On party lines
in the country it is not considered a heinous offense
to eavesdrop over the telephone, but the
conversation there is for the most part harmless
neighborhood gossip and it does not matter
greatly who hears it. In business it is different.
But it is practically impossible for any one except
the operator to overhear a conversation except
by accident, and it is a misdemeanor punishable
by law for her to give a message to
any one other than the person for whom it was
intended.</p>

<p>In every office there should be a large enough
mechanical equipment manned by an efficient
staff to take care of the telephone traffic without
delay. &ldquo;The line is busy&rdquo; given in answer to a
call three or four times will send the person who
is calling to some other place to have his wants
looked after.</p>

<p>Few places appreciate the tremendous volume
of business that comes in by way of telephone or
the possibilities which it offers to increase business
opportunities. They are as short-sighted
as the department store which, a good many years
ago, when telephones were new, had them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>stalled
but took them out after a few weeks because
the clerks were kept so busy taking orders
over them that they did not have time to attend
to the customers who came into the store!</p>

<p>Another important vantage point which, like
the telephone, suffers from neglect is the reception
desk. Millions of dollars' worth of business
is lost every year and perfect sandstorms
and cyclones of animosity are generated because
business men have not yet learned the great
value of having the right kind of person to receive
visitors. To the strangers who come&mdash;and
among the idlers and swindlers and beggars who
assail every successful business house are potential
good friends and customers&mdash;this person
represents the firm,&mdash;is, for the time being, the
firm itself.</p>

<p>It is very childish for a man to turn away from
a reception desk because he does not like the manner
of the person behind it, but business men, sensible
ones at that, do it every day. Pleasant connections
of years' standing are sometimes broken
off and valuable business propositions are carried
to rival concerns because of indifferent or insolent
treatment at the front door. Only a short time
ago an advertising agency lost a contract for
which it had been working two years on account
of the way the girl at the door received the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
who came to place it. He dropped in without
previous appointment and was met by a blonde
young lady with highly tinted cheeks who tilted
herself forward on the heels of her French pumps
and pertly inquired what he wanted. He told
her. &ldquo;Mr. Hunt isn't in.&rdquo; &ldquo;When will he be
back?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; and she swung around
on the impossible heels. The man deliberated
a moment and then swung around on his heels
(which were very flat and sensible) and carried
the contract to another agency. Instances of
this kind might be multiplied. Some business
men would have persisted until they got what
they wanted from the young lady. Others would
have angrily reported her to the head of her office,
but the majority would have acted as this
man did.</p>

<p>Most men (and women), whether they are in
business or not, do not underestimate their own
importance and they like to feel that the rest of
the world does not either. They do not like to
be kept waiting; they like to be received with
a nice deference, not haughtily; they do not like
to be sent to the wrong department; and they
love (and so do we all) talking to important people.
Realizing this, banks and trust companies
and other big organizations have had to appoint
nearly as many vice-presidents as there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
second-lieutenants during the war to take care
of their self-important visitors. Even those
whose time is not worth ten cents (a number of
them are women) like to be treated as if it were
worth a great deal. It is, for the most part, an
innocent desire which does no one any special
harm, and any business that sets out to serve
the public (and there is no other kind) has to
take into account all the caprices of human vanity.
We cannot get away from it. Benjamin
Franklin placed humility among the virtues he
wished to cultivate, but after a time declared it
impossible. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I overcame pride
I would be proud of my humility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Courtesy is the first requirement of the business
host or hostess and after that, intelligence.
Some business houses make the mistake of putting
back of the reception desk a girl who has
proved herself too dull-witted to serve anywhere
else. The smiling idiot with which this country
(and others) so abounds may be harmless and
even useful if she is kept busy behind the lines,
but, placed out where she is a buffer between the
house and the outside world, she is a positive affliction.
She may be pleasant enough, but the
caller who comes for information and can get
nothing but a smile will go away feeling about as
cheerful as if he had stuck his hand into a jar of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
honey when he was a mile or so away from soap,
water, and towel.</p>

<p>A litter of office boys sprawling untidily over
the desks and chairs in the reception room is as
bad, and a snappy young lady of the &ldquo;Now see
here, kid&rdquo; variety is worse.</p>

<p>The position is not an easy one, especially in
places where there is a constant influx of miscellaneous
callers, and it is hardly fair to ask a
young girl to fill it. In England they use elderly
men and in a number of offices over here, too.
Their age and manner automatically protect
them (and incidentally their firms) from many
undesirables that a boy or girl in the same position
would have considerable difficulty in handling.
And they lend the place an air of dignity
and reserve quite impossible with a youngster.</p>

<p>In some offices, especially in those where large
amounts of money are stored or handled, there
are door men in uniform and often plain clothes
huskies near the entrances to protect the people
(and the money) on the inside from cranks and
crooks and criminals. In others, a physician's
office, for instance, or any small office where the
people who are likely to come are of the gentler
sort, a young girl with a pleasing manner will do
just as well as and perhaps better than any one
else. In big companies where there are many de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>partments,
it is customary to maintain a regular
bureau of information to which the caller who is
not sure whom or what he wants is first directed,
but the majority of businesses have only one person
who is delegated to receive the people who
come and either direct them to the person they
want to see or turn them aside.</p>

<p>Most of them must be turned aside. If the
stage managers in New York interviewed all the
girls who want to see them, they would have no
time left for anything else, and the same thing is
true of nearly every man who is prominent in
business or in some other way. (Charlie Chaplin
received 73,000 letters during the first three
days he was in England. Suppose he had personally
read each of them!) Hundreds of people
must be turned away, but every person who
approaches a firm either to get something from
it or to give something to it has a right to attention.
Men are in business to work, not to entertain,
and they must protect themselves. But the
people who are turned away must be turned
away courteously, and the business house which
has found some one who can do it has cause to
rise and give thanks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h3>TRAVELING AND SELLING</h3>

<p>The etiquette of traveling includes very few
points not covered by the general laws of good
behavior. Keeping one's place in line before the
ticket window, having money ready and moving
aside as quickly as possible instead of lingering
to converse with the ticket-seller about train
schedules and divers other interesting subjects
are primary rules. It is permissible to make
sure that the train is the right one before getting
on it, but it is unnecessary to do it more than half
a dozen times. When the sign over the gate
says &ldquo;Train for Bellevue&rdquo; it probably <i>is</i> the
train for Bellevue, and when the guard at the
gate repeats that it is the train for Bellevue the
chances are that he is telling the truth.</p>

<p>An experienced traveler usually carries very
little baggage. A lot of suitcases and grips are
bothersome, not only to the one who has charge
of them, but also to those who are cramped into
small quarters because of them. A traveler
may make himself as comfortable as he likes so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
long as it is not at the expense of the other passengers.
If they object to an open window the
window must stay down. Lounging over a seat
is bad form, especially if there is some one else in
it. So is prowling from one end of the car to
the other. Besides, it makes some people nervous.
Snoring is impolite and so is talking in
one's sleep, but they are beyond remedy. Talking
with the person in the berth above or below is
not, however, and is much more disturbing than
the noise of the train. Forgetting the number
of one's berth and blundering into the wrong
place is a serious breach of good manners in a
sleeping car, and it is extremely severe on timid
persons who have gone to bed with visions before
their minds of the man who was murdered in
lower ten and the woman who brought her husband's
corpse from Florida in the same berth
with her.</p>

<p>Among men, &ldquo;picking up&rdquo; acquaintances on a
train or boat is allowable if it comes about in a
natural way, but there are men who object to it.
Many business men do not discontinue their
work because they are traveling. Portable
typewriters, secretaries, the telegraph and other
means of swift communication have made it possible
for them to accomplish almost as much as
if they were in the office back home. Such men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
do not like to be interrupted, and if a garrulous
or an intrusive person approaches it is within the
bounds of courtesy to turn him aside. Generally,
however, there is a comradery of the road,
a sort of good fellowship among voyagers which
lets down ordinary bars, and the men who like
to rest as they travel find it highly diverting and
interesting to talk with other men from various
parts of the country. This holds true in hotels,
especially in the commercial hotels, where traveling
men foregather to meet their customers
and transact their business, and in hotels in small
places where the possibilities for amusement are
limited and the people have to depend on one
another for entertainment. But there are limits.
No man should ever thrust himself upon another
and it is almost an iron clad rule that he should
never &ldquo;pick up&rdquo; women acquaintances when
traveling. It is permissible to talk with them,
but not to annoy them with personal attentions
nor to place them under obligation by paying
their bills. If a man and a woman who are traveling
on the same train fall into conversation and
go into the dining car together, each one should
pay his or her own check, or if he insists upon
paying at the table she should insist upon settling
afterwards. In hotels also this is essentially
true.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Hotels are judged more by the people who
come to them than by anything else. The guests
indicate the quality of the service, and for this
reason, most hotels prefer that they be gentlemen.
There is an atmosphere about a first-class
hotel that frightens away second-rate people.
Most places have standards and many a man has
been turned away even when there was an empty
room because the management did not like his
looks.</p>

<p>Tipping is one of the most vexatious petty
problems with which a traveler is confronted.
It is an undemocratic custom which every sensible
man deplores but sees no way around.
Waiters, porters, and other functionaries who
are in positions to receive tips draw very small
salaries, if any. They depend upon the generosity
of the public they serve. The system may
be all wrong (we believe it is) but it means
bread and butter to those who live by it, and it is
only just, as matters are now arranged, for the
traveler to pay. It is foolish to tip extravagantly
or to tip every pirate who performs even
the most trifling service, but a small fee, especially
if the service has been good, is a courtesy
not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Tipping originally grew out of kindness. The
knight who had received special attention at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
hands of his squire expressed his gratitude by a
special reward. The word &ldquo;gratuity&rdquo; itself indicates
that the little gift was once simply a
spontaneous act of thoughtfulness. It has degenerated
into a perfunctory habit, but it should
not be so. Excellent service deserves a recompense
just as slip-shod service does not. And
no one has a right to spoil a waiter (or any one
else) by tipping him for inefficient work. In
hotels and restaurants the standard fee is ten
per cent of the bill.</p>

<p>Regular travelling of any kind even under
favorable circumstances is a great wear and tear
on the disposition. Commuters who go in and
out of town every day are a notoriously hag-ridden
lot, and the men who go on the road are
not much better. But there is one enormous difference.
It is the privilege of the commuter to
growl as much as he likes about the discomforts
of the road and the stupidity of the men who
make up the time tables, but travelling men&mdash;we
are speaking of salesmen especially&mdash;can never
indulge in the luxury of a grouch. One of the
biggest parts of his job is to keep cheerful all
the time and that in itself is no small task. (Try
it and see.) A farmer can wear a frown as
heavy as a summer thunder cloud and the potatoes
will grow just the same; a mechanic can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
swear at the automobile he is putting into shape
(a very impolite thing to do even when there is
no one but the machine to hear), and the bolts
and screws will hold just as fast; a lawyer can
knit his brows over his brief case and come to his
solution just as quickly as if he sat grinning at
it, but the salesman must smile, smile, smile. The
season may be dull, the crops may be bad, there
may be strikes, lockouts, depressions and deflations,
unemployment&mdash;it makes no difference&mdash;he
must keep cheerful. It is the courtesy of
salesmanship, and it is this quality more than any
other that makes selling a young man's job&mdash;we
do not mean in years, but in spirit&mdash;an old
one could not stand it.</p>

<p>In the good old days when the country was
young and everybody, from all accounts we can
gather, was happy, salesmen in the present sense
of the term were almost unknown. There were
peddlers, characters as picturesque as gipsies, who
travelled about the country preying chiefly on
the farmers. Often they spent the night&mdash;hotel
accommodations were few and houses were far
apart&mdash;and entertained the family with lively
tales of life on the road. Next morning they
gave the children trifling presents, swindled the
farmer out of several dollars and made themselves
generally agreeable. The farmer took it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
all in good part and looked forward with pleasure
to the next visit. The peddlers came in pairs
then, like snakes, but they were for the most part
welcome and there was genuine regret when they
became things of the past like top-buggies and
Prince Albert coats.</p>

<p>After the peddler came the drummer, a rough,
noisy chap, as his name indicates, harmless
enough, but economically not much more significant
than the peddler. He stayed in the business
district where he was tolerated with good-natured
indulgence. He was less objectionable than the
man who followed him, the agent. He was (and
is) a house-to-house and office-to-office canvasser
and a general nuisance. He sold everything
from books to life insurance, from patent potato
peelers to opera glasses. He still survives, but
not in large numbers, for his work, like that of
the peddler and the drummer, has been swallowed
up by the salesman.</p>

<p>The rewards which modern salesmanship holds
out to those who succeed at it are so large that
the field has attracted all kinds of men, highly
efficient ones who love the game for its own sake,
grossly incompetent ones who, having failed at
something else, have decided to try this, and adventurers
who believe they see in it a chance to
get rich quick. The teachers of salesmanship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
tell us that we are all selling something, even
when there is no visible product. The worker,
according to them, is selling his services just as
the salesman is selling goods. It may be true,
but we all could not (and it is a blessing) go out
and sell things in the ordinary sense in which we
use the word. Some of us have to be producers.
But the salesman's work is important. We do
not discredit it.</p>

<p>Salesmanship is built on faith. A man must
believe in his product and then must make other
people believe in it as firmly as he does. So devoted
are some salesmen to their work that it is
difficult to tell whether they consider their calling
a trade, a profession, a science, or a religion.
Sometimes it is all four. Sometimes it goes beyond
them and becomes a kind of mesmerism in
which the salesman uses a sort of hypnotic process
(which is simply the result of being over-anxious
to sell) to persuade the prospect that he
cannot wait another day before buying the particular
article that the salesman is distributing.
The article may be stocks and bonds, wash cloths,
soap, or hair nets. It makes no difference, but
he must be filled with enthusiasm and must be
able to pass it along. And this very virtue which
is the foundation of successful salesmanship is
likely to lead the salesman into gross rudeness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
For the man who is selling is so eager and so
earnest that he forgets that the man who is buying
may have his own ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>The first step in salesmanship is to acquire a
thorough knowledge of the product. The next
is to gain access to the man who is to buy it. This
is not always easy. Business men have been
annoyed so much by agents that they have had to
erect barriers, in many instances almost impenetrable
ones. It is especially difficult in big
cities where the pressure is heavy, but most worth
while business men have learned the value of
contact with the world outside and are willing to
give almost any man an interview if he can show
a valid reason why he should have it. Whether
he gets a second interview or not depends upon
how he handled the first one.</p>

<p>There are many ways of getting into an office.
A salesman usually stands a much better chance
if he writes ahead for an appointment. It is
much more courteous to ask a man when he
wants to see you than to drop in on him casually
and trust to luck that the time is not inopportune.
Some salesmen are afraid to write because
they think the knowledge of what they
have to sell will prejudice the prospect against
it. At the same time they feel that if they can
only get a chance to talk to him a few minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
they can over-ride the prejudice. A salesman
may come into an office without letting the man
know what his purpose is (though it is best to
begin with cards on the table) but he will not
come in (unless he is a crook) under false pretenses.</p>

<p>The friends of a salesman can sometimes be
very useful to him in presenting him to valuable
prospects, and when they feel that the meeting
will result in mutual benefit they are glad to do
it. Sometimes the friend will give a letter or
a card of introduction. Sometimes he will telephone
or speak for an appointment. It is best
when these come unsolicited, though it is permissible
to ask for them. No man should depend
upon the help of his friends. A salesman should
be able to stand on his own feet, and if he and his
product together do not form a strong enough
combination to break down all obstructions there
is something wrong with one or the other of
them.</p>

<p>The best card of admission at the door of a
business office is a pleasing personal appearance
coupled with a calm and assured manner. This
is a universal standard of measuring a man's
character and calibre. Until we have heard him
speak we judge him by the way he looks. It is
a dangerous practice, as the proverb warns us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
but the percentage of hits is high enough to make
us continue to use it.</p>

<p>A favorite device with a certain cheap type of
salesman is to give his name to the girl at the entrance
desk and ask her to tell Mr. Brown that
Mr. Green has sent Mr. Smith to call. The Mr.
Green is entirely fictitious, but since Mr. Brown
has several business acquaintances of that name,
he interrupts his work and comes out to see Mr.
Smith and discovers that he is a life insurance
agent who thinks that if he can once get inside
he can &ldquo;put it across.&rdquo; Most business men have
no use for such practices and rarely allow the
salesmen who employ them to stay in their offices
any longer than it takes to get them out. Besides,
the salesman places himself under a handicap
to begin with. He will find it pretty hard
to convince the man in the office that he is not
dishonest about his goods just as he is about himself.
He is the greatest enemy of his profession.
And he makes the work of every one else engaged
in it infinitely harder. It is something
every business and profession has to fight against&mdash;the
dishonest grafter who is using it as a means
of swindling society.</p>

<p>Most salesmen give their names at the entrance
desk instead of presenting their cards.
Psychologists and experience have taught them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
that the card is distracting and that even if the
interview is granted it is harder to get the attention
of the other man if he has a card to twiddle
between his fingers. It is more conventional to
send in a card (a good card is a letter of introduction
in itself) but if the salesman finds it a
handicap, however slight, he should by all means
dispense with it. If the card is cheap or flashy
or offensive in any way it arouses prejudice
against the man who bears it before he has had a
chance to present his case in person. The business
card may be the same as the personal card,
simply a bit of pasteboard bearing the name and
perhaps the address, or it may be larger than the
ordinary personal card and bear the name of the
firm for which the salesman is working, and in
addition, if it is a very simple design, the trademark
of the firm.</p>

<p>Whether to rise when a caller enters and shake
hands is a question to be settled by each person
according to the way he likes best. It is certainly
more gracious to rise and ask him to be
seated before resuming one's own place. But
promiscuous handshaking is an American habit
which Europeans as a rule frown upon and in
which a number of Americans do not indulge,
for they like the grasp of their hand to mean
something more than a careless greeting and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
reserve it for their friends. In any case, the
caller should not be the first to extend his
hand.</p>

<p>If a man is accustomed to see a great number
of people he will find it too much of a strain on
his vitality to shake hands with them all. Roosevelt
used to surprise strangers with the laxness
of his grasp, but the Colonel had learned to conserve
his strength in small things so that he
might give it to great ones. The President of
the United States has more than once in the
course of the history of our country come to the
end of the day with his hands bleeding from the
number of times people have pressed it during
the day. Now the President ought to be willing
to give his life for his country, but he ought
not to be required to give it in this way. It
probably meant a great deal to each one of the
people in the throng to be able to say, &ldquo;I once
shook hands with the President,&rdquo; but how much
more it would have meant if each one of them
could have said, &ldquo;One day I helped my President,&rdquo;
even if the help was so small an act of
thoughtfulness as forbearing to shake his hand.</p>

<p>But to get back to salesmen: Some of them
have a way, especially the over-zealous ones, of
getting as close to the prospect as is physically
possible. They place their papers or their brief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
cases on the desk before which the prospect is
sitting, hitch their chairs up as close as they can,
and talk with their breath in his face. No one
likes this and it is only a rude and thoughtless
salesman who is guilty of it. One man who had
been vexed by it over and over again had the
visitor's chair nailed to the floor in his office
some little distance from his own. And he
never had a caller who didn't try to move it
nearer to him!</p>

<p>For years it has been the habit for business
men to receive their callers at their desks, but
lately there has been a turning away from this.
The desk is usually littered with papers and letters
which the caller can hardly help reading, and
there are constant interruptions from the telephone
and the other members of the office. For
these reasons a number of business men are going
out to see their callers instead of bringing them
in to see them, a practice which is much more cordial
than the other if one can afford the time for
it. One big business house abolished its large
reception room and built in a number of smaller
ones instead. In this way each visitor has privacy
and there is a feeling of hospitality and
coziness about the little room which the bigger
one failed to give. Each room was fitted up
with comfortable chairs, books, and magazines so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
that if the caller had to wait he would have the
means of entertaining himself.</p>

<p>Once a man agrees to see a salesman or other
visitor he should give, in so far as it is possible,
his full attention to him. It is better to refuse an
audience altogether than to give it grudgingly.
A prominent man cannot possibly see all of the
people, salesmen and whatnot, who want to talk
with him or he would have no time left to keep
himself prominent. A busy man has to protect
himself against the cranks and idlers who try to
gain access to him, and most men have to have
devices by which they can rid themselves of objectionable
or tiresome callers. One man who
has a constant stream of visitors has only one
chair in his office, and he sits in it. Another
never allows a visitor to enter his office, but goes
to the outer reception room and stands while he
talks. One man stands up as a signal that the
interview is at an end. Another begins to fumble
with the papers on his desk, and the salesman
does not live who is not familiar with the man
who must hurry out to lunch or who has only five
minutes to catch a train. One man has his secretary
or his office boy interrupt him after a visitor
has been in as much as ten minutes, to tell him
that Mr. So-and-So is waiting outside. Another
rises to his feet and walks slowly toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
door, the salesman following, until he has maneuvered
him out. If the salesman is a man of sense
none of these devices will be necessary. He knows
that a courteous and prompt departure helps his
cause much more than an annoying persistence,
and the man who stays after his prospect's mind
has lost every interest except to get him out of
the way is lacking in one of the fundamentals of
social good manners as well as business good
manners. Rarely, perhaps never, does he succeed.
For the successful salesman is the one
who can put himself into his prospect's place and
let him know that he has made a study of his
needs and is there to help him.</p>

<p>Carefully prepared approaches and memorized
speeches are worth much to the beginner,
but an agility in adapting himself is much
more important. Ludendorff failed to get to
Paris because his original plan was upset and he
could not think quickly enough to rally the German
army and attack from a different angle.
Most salesmen have to talk to men who are continually
interrupted to attend to something else.
And most business men know what they want, or
think they do, and when they ask a direct question
they want a direct answer. Many a young
salesman has ruined himself so far as his career
was concerned because he went out with instruc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>tions
to keep the interview in his hands and every
time the man he was &ldquo;selling&rdquo; asked a question
he passed airily over it and kept stubbornly on
the road he had mapped out for himself. The
salesman cannot think in theoretical terms; he
must think concretely and from the point of view
of the man he is trying to convince. As one very
excellent salesman has put it, he must get the
prospect's own story and tell it to him in different
words, and if he can actually show him a way
to decrease expenses or to increase output he
will win not only his attention, but his heart as
well.</p>

<p>The salesman must be absorbed in his commodity,
but not to the exclusion of the man he is
trying to &ldquo;sell.&rdquo; A beginner of this type went
into a man's office some time ago and rattled off
a speech he had memorized about some charts.
The man listened until he came to the end&mdash;the
boy was talking so rapidly and excitedly that it
would have been hard to interrupt him except by
shouting at him&mdash;and then quietly told him that
he had not been able to understand a word of
what he had said. &ldquo;You have not been talking
to me,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You have been talking
at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another salesman of the same general kind
went into the office of a busy lawyer one morn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>ing
recently in a building which happened to be
owned by the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to give you some books,&rdquo; he announced.</p>

<p>The lawyer asked him what they were, but the
salesman refused to be diverted before he had
led up to the dramatic moment in his carefully
planned speech at which he thought it best to
mention the name of the books. He went through
the whole of his canvass and then thrust a paper
under the lawyer's face with &ldquo;Sign here&rdquo; above
the dotted line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to give them to
me,&rdquo; the lawyer said.</p>

<p>The salesman began to explain that of course
he could not give him the books outright and so
on and on and on&mdash;everybody has heard this part
of his speech. The lawyer laughed and the salesman
lost his temper. Very angry, he started out
of the room. Near the door which opened into
the hall was another door which opened into a
closet that contained a shelf which was a little
more than five feet high. The salesman opened
this door by mistake and struck his head smartly
against the shelf. This made him angrier than
ever. He jerked the other door open and
slammed it behind him with a crash that nearly
broke the glass out. This was more than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
lawyer could stand. He sprang up and started
in pursuit of the salesman, who by this time was
on his way into another office in the same building.
The lawyer asked him where he was going.
The salesman told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in my building,&rdquo; the lawyer said. &ldquo;I
can't have the men who have offices here disturbed
by people who act like this. Now go on,&rdquo;
he added kindly but firmly, &ldquo;and let's forget that
you ever came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the salesman went.</p>

<p>Salesmanship is service, and the man who persuades
another to buy something he knows he
does not want, does not need, and cannot use, is
a scoundrel. &ldquo;Good salesmanship,&rdquo; and this is
the only sort that any self-respecting man will
engage in, &ldquo;is selling goods that won't come
back to customers that will.&rdquo; It is cumulative
in its effect, and the man who sells another something
that really fills a want wins his eternal
gratitude and friendship. He tells his friends
about it, they come to the same salesman and the
product begins almost to sell itself. But it takes
patience and courtesy to bring it up to this point.</p>

<p>Some salesmen kill a territory on their first
trip. Bad manners can do it very easily. Sometimes
they make themselves so objectionable that
the customer will buy to get rid of them, espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>cially
if the purchase does not involve more than
a dollar or two. Sometimes they carry the customer
along so smoothly with plausible arguments
that they persuade him to buy something
that he knows he does not want. It is all right
so long as the salesman is present, but discontent
follows in his trail. Sometimes&mdash;stocks and
bonds salesmen are guilty here&mdash;they wheedle
the customer into buying more than he can afford,
beginning on the premise that since their
stocks are good (and the men who sell fraudulent
ones use the same methods) a man should if
he has a hundred dollars buy a hundred dollars'
worth, if he has a million he should buy a million
dollars' worth, if he has a home he must mortgage
it, if he has an automobile he must sell it.
No good salesman works like this. People are
very gullible and it takes little argument to persuade
them to invest nearly all they have in something
that will make them rich in a hurry, but the
fact that they are foolish is not quite sufficient
justification for fooling them. Even if the
stocks and bonds are all the salesman believes
and represents them to be, no man has a right to
risk his home or his happiness for them. A
worth while salesman leaves his customer satisfied
and comes back a year later and finds him
still satisfied. And this sort of customer is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
best advertisement and the best friend any business
can have.</p>

<p>Bad salesmen create violent prejudices against
the firms they represent. For the average customer,
like the average man, judges the whole of
a thing by the part that he sees. To most of
us the word Chinaman calls up the picture of
the laundryman around the corner in spite of
the fact that there are some three hundred million
Chinamen in the world engaged in other occupations.
Salesmen who are consumed with
their own importance do their firms more harm
than good. They usually are men in positions
too big for them (they may not be very big at
that) and are for the most part of not much more
real consequence than the gnat which sat on the
tip of the bull's horn and cried, &ldquo;See what a dust
I raise!&rdquo; Glum and sullen salesmen&mdash;there are
not many of them&mdash;are of little genuine value to
their firms. It is not true that when you weep
you weep alone. Gloomy moods are as contagious
as pleasant ones, and a happy man radiates
happiness.</p>

<p>It is not easy to look pleasant when one's
nerves are bruised from miscellaneous contacts
with all sorts of people, but it is an actual fact
that assuming the gestures of a mood will often
induce the mood itself. The man who forces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
himself to <i>look</i> cheerful (we are not talking
about the one who takes on an idiotic grin) may
find himself after a while beginning to <i>feel</i>
cheerful. After he has greeted the elevator boy
with a smile (it may be a very crooked one) and the
hotel clerk and the waitress and the bootblack
and the paper boy he is likely to find that the smile
has straightened out into a genuine one. It does
not always work&mdash;it is like counting to a hundred
when one is angry&mdash;but it is worth trying.</p>

<p>Salesmen find their greatest difficulties among
people of little education. It is the people with
fewest ideas that cling to them most tenaciously.
Scholars and scientists and business men who
have learned to employ scientific methods are
constantly watching for something new. They
welcome new discoveries and new ideas, but the
man in the backwoods of ignorance has a fence
around the limits of his mind and it is hard for
anything to get inside it. He is open to conviction,
but like the Scotsman, he would like to
see the person who could &ldquo;convict&rdquo; him. It is
hard work to get a new idea into the mind of a
man who is encased in a shell of ignorance or
prejudice, but the salesman is worse than bad-mannered
who lets another man, whoever he is,
know that he thinks his religion is no good, that
his political party is rotten, that his country is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
not worth a cancelled postage stamp, and that
the people of his race are &ldquo;frogs,&rdquo; &ldquo;square-heads,&rdquo;
&ldquo;dagos,&rdquo; &ldquo;wops,&rdquo; or &ldquo;kikes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Salesmen who are themselves courteous usually
meet with courtesy. The people who move
graciously through life find comparatively little
rudeness in the world. And a good salesman is
courteous to all men alike. With him overalls
command as much respect as broadcloth. It
pays&mdash;not only in money, but in other things that
are worth more.</p>

<p>A salesman should be especially careful of his
attitude toward the representatives of rival
houses and their products. His eagerness to
advance his own cause should never lead him into
belittling them. He need not go out of his way
to praise them nor should he speak of them insincerely
in glowing terms; but an honest word
of commendation shows that he is not afraid of
his rivals in spite of the fact that they too have
excellent goods, and when it is impossible to
speak well of them it is best to stay silent.</p>

<p>It is not hard to see why business men spend so
much time and effort in selecting their salesmen.
They know that one who is ill-mannered or offensive
in any way indicates either a lack of breeding
or a lack of judgment on the part of the parent
concern. And one is about as bad as the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h3>THE BUSINESS OF WRITING</h3>

<p>Half the business letters which are written
should never be written at all, and of the other
half so many are incomplete or incoherent that a
transaction which could be finished and filed away
in two letters frequently requires six or eight.</p>

<p>A good letter is the result of clear thinking
and careful planning. In the case of the sales-letter
it sometimes takes several weeks to write
one, but for ordinary correspondence a few minutes
is usually all that is necessary. The length
of time does not matter&mdash;it is the sort of letter
which is produced at the end of it.</p>

<p>Books of commercial correspondence give a
number of rules and standards by which a letter
can be measured. But all rules of thumb are
dangerous, and there are only two items which
are essential. The others are valuable only as
they contribute to them. The letter must succeed
in getting its idea across and it must build
up good will for its firm. And the best one is
the one which accomplishes this most courteously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and most completely in the briefest space of
time (and paper).</p>

<p>There should be a reason back of every letter
if it is only to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to a customer.
Too much of our national energy goes up in
waste effort, in aimless advertising, worthless
salesmanship, ineffective letter writing, and in a
thousand and one other ways. A lot of it is
hammered out on the typewriters transcribing
perfectly useless letters to paper which might
really be worth something if it were given over to
a different purpose.</p>

<p>A good letter never attracts the mind of the
reader to itself as a thing apart from its contents.
Last year a publishing house sent out a hundred
test letters advertising one of their books. Three
answers came back, none of them ordering the
book, but all three praising the letter. One was
from a teacher of commercial English who declared
that he was going to use it as a model in
his classes, and the other two congratulated the
firm on having so excellent a correspondent.
The physical make-up of the letter was attractive,
it was written by a college graduate and
couched in clear, correct, and colorful English.
And yet it was no good. No <i>letter and no advertisement
is any good which calls attention to itself
instead of the message it is trying to deliver</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>There is not much room for individuality in
the make-up of a letter. Custom has standardized
it, and startling variations from the conventional
format indicates freakishness rather than
originality. They are like that astonishing gentleman
who walks up Fifth Avenue on the coldest
mornings in the year, bareheaded, coatless, sockless,
clad in white flannels and tennis slippers.
He attracts attention, but he makes us shiver.</p>

<p>Plain white paper of good quality is always in
good taste. Certain dull-tinted papers are not
bad, but gaudy colors, flashy designs, and ornate
letter heads are taboo in all high types of business.
Simple headings giving explicit and useful
information are best. The name and address
of the firm (and &ldquo;New York&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chicago&rdquo;
is not sufficient in spite of the fact that a
good many places go into no more detail than
this), the cable address if it has one, the telephone
number and the trademark if it is an inconspicuous
one (there is a difference between <i>conspicuous</i>
and <i>distinctive</i>) are all that any business
house needs.</p>

<p>Hotels are often pictured on their own stationery
in a way that is anything but modest, but
there is a very good reason for it. The first
thing most people want to know about a hotel is
what sort of looking place it is. All right, here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
you are. Some factories, especially those that
are proud of their appearance, carry their own
picture on their stationery. There is nothing to
say against it, but one of the most beautiful factories
in America has on its letter head only the
name of the firm, the address, and a small trademark
engraved in black. Sometimes a picture,
in a sales letter, for instance, supplements the
written matter in a most effective way. And
whenever any kind of device is really helpful it
should by all means be used, subject only to the
limits of good taste.</p>

<p>It is more practical in business to use standard
size envelopes. If window envelopes are used
the window should be clear, the paper white or
nearly so, and the typewritten address a good
honest black. The enclosure should fit snugly
and should be placed so that the address is in
plain view without having to be jiggled around
in the envelope first. A letter passes through
the hands of several postal clerks before it
reaches the person to whom it is addressed, and
if each one of them has to stop to play with it
awhile an appreciable amount of time is lost, not
to mention the strain it puts on their respective
tempers. The paper of which an envelope is
made should always be opaque enough to conceal
the contents of the letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Practically all business letters are typewritten.
Occasionally a &ldquo;Help Wanted&rdquo; advertisement
requests that the answer be in the applicant's
own handwriting, but even this is rare.
In most places the typing is taken care of by
girls who have been trained for the purpose, but
most young girls just entering business are
highly irresponsible, and it is necessary for the
men and women who dictate the letters to know
what constitutes a pleasing make-up so that they
can point out the flaws and give suggestions for
doing away with them.</p>

<p>The letter should be arranged symmetrically on
the page with ample margins all around. Nothing
but experience in copying her own notes will
teach a stenographer to estimate them correctly
so that she will not have to rewrite badly placed
letters. It is a little point, but an important
one.</p>

<p>Each subject considered in a letter should be
treated in a separate paragraph, and each paragraph
should be set off from the others by a
wider space than that between the lines, double
space between the paragraphs when there is
single space between the lines, triple space between
the paragraphs when there is a double
space between the lines, and so on.</p>

<p>A business letter should handle only one sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ject.
Two letters should be dispatched if two
subjects are to be covered. This enables the
house receiving the letter to file it so that it can
be found when it is needed.</p>

<p>When a letter is addressed to an individual it
is better to begin &ldquo;Dear Mr. Brown&rdquo; or &ldquo;My
dear Mr. Brown&rdquo; than &ldquo;Dear Sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;My dear
Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gentlemen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ladies&rdquo; is sometime
used in salutation when a letter is addressed to a
group. &ldquo;Dear Friend&rdquo; is permissible in general
letters sent out to persons of both sexes. Honorary
titles should be used in the address when
they take the place of &ldquo;Mr.,&rdquo; such titles as Reverend,
Doctor, Honorable (abbreviated to Rev.,
Dr., Hon.,) and the like. Titles should not be
dropped except in the case of personal letters.</p>

<p>Special care should be taken with the outside
address. State abbreviations should be used
sparingly when there is a chance of confusion as
in the case of Ga., Va., La., and Pa. &ldquo;City&rdquo; is
not sufficient and should never be used. Nor
should the name of the state ever be omitted
even when the letter is addressed to some other
point in the same state, as from New York to
Brooklyn. And postage should be complete.
A letter on which there is two cents due has
placed itself under a pretty severe handicap before
it is opened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>It is astonishing how many letters go out every
day unsigned, lacking enclosures, carrying the
wrong addresses, bearing insufficient postage,
and showing other evidences of carelessness and
thoughtlessness. In a town in New England
last year one of the specialty shops received at
Christmas time twenty different lots of money&mdash;money
orders, stamps, and cash&mdash;by mail, not
one of which bore the slightest clue to the identity
of the sender. Countless times during the
year this happens in every mail order house.</p>

<p>The initials of the dictator and of the stenographer
in the lower left-hand corner of a letter
serve not only to identify the carbon, but often
to place the letter itself if it has gone out without
signature. The signature should be legible,
or if the one who writes it enjoys making flourishes
he may do so if he will have the name neatly
typed either just below the name or just above
it. It should be written in ink (black or blue
ink), not in pencil or colored crayon, and it
should be blotted before the page is folded. The
dictator himself should sign the letter whenever
possible. &ldquo;Dictated but not read&rdquo; bears the
mark of discourtesy and sometimes brings back
a letter with &ldquo;Received but not read&rdquo; written
across it. When it is necessary to leave the office
before signing his letters, a business man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
should deputize his stenographer to do it, in
which case she writes his name in full with her
initials just below it. A better plan is to have
another person take care of the entire letter, beginning
it something like, &ldquo;Since Mr. Blake is
away from the office to-day he has asked me to
let you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The complimentary close to a business letter
should be &ldquo;Yours truly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yours sincerely&rdquo; or
something of the kind, and not &ldquo;Yours cordially,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yours faithfully&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yours gratefully&rdquo;
unless the circumstances warrant it.</p>

<p>In writing a letter as a part of a large organization
one should use &ldquo;We&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I.&rdquo; A
firm acts collectively, no one except the president
has a right to the pronoun of the first person,
and he (if he is wise) seldom avails himself
of it. If the matter is so near personal as to
make &ldquo;We&rdquo; somewhat ridiculous &ldquo;I&rdquo; should, of
course, be used instead. But one should be consistent.
If &ldquo;I&rdquo; is used at the beginning it should
be continued throughout.</p>

<p>Similarly a letter should be addressed to a firm
rather than to a person, for if the person happens
to be absent some one else can then take charge of
it. But the address should also include the name
of the addressee (whenever possible) or &ldquo;Advertising
Manager,&rdquo; &ldquo;Personnel Manager&rdquo; or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
whatever the designation of his position may be.
The name may be placed in the lower left-hand
corner of the letter &ldquo;Attention Mr. Green&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Attention Advertising Manager,&rdquo; and it may
also be placed just above the salutation inside the
letter. Sometimes the subject of the letter is indicated
in the same way, <i>Re Montana shipment</i>,
<i>Re Smythe manuscript</i>, etc. These lines may be
typed in red or in capital letters so as to catch the
attention of the reader at once. If a letter is
more than two pages long this line is often added
to the succeeding pages, a very convenient device,
for letters are sometimes misplaced in the
files and this helps to locate them.</p>

<p>A business letter should never be longer than
necessary. If three lines are enough it is absurd
to use more, especially if the letter is going
to a firm which handles a big correspondence.
Some one has said with more truth than exaggeration
that no man south of Fourteenth Street
in New York reads a letter more than three
lines long. But there is danger that the too
brief letter will sound brusque. Mail order
houses which serve the small towns and the rural
districts say that, all other things being equal, it
is the long sales letter which brings in the best
results. Farmers have more leisure and they
are quite willing to read long letters <i>if</i> (and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
this <i>if</i> is worth taking note of) they are interesting.</p>

<p>All unnecessary words and all stilted phrases
should be stripped from a letter. &ldquo;Replying to
your esteemed favor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yours of the 11th inst.
to hand, contents noted,&rdquo; &ldquo;Yours of the 24th
ult. received. In reply would say,&rdquo; &ldquo;Awaiting
a favorable reply,&rdquo; &ldquo;We beg to remain&rdquo; are dead
weights. &ldquo;Prox&rdquo; might be added to the list,
and &ldquo;In reply to same.&rdquo; &ldquo;Per diem&rdquo; and other
Latin expressions should likewise be thrown into
the discard. &ldquo;As per our agreement of the 17th&rdquo;
should give place to &ldquo;According to our agreement
of the 17th,&rdquo; and, wherever possible, simplified
expression should be employed. Legal
phraseology should be restricted to the profession
to which it belongs. Wills, deeds, and
other documents likely to be haled into court
need &ldquo;whereas's&rdquo; and &ldquo;wherefores&rdquo; and &ldquo;said's&rdquo;
and &ldquo;same's&rdquo; without end, but ordinary business
letters do not. It is perfectly possible to
express oneself clearly in the language of conversation
(which is also the language of business)
without burying the meaning in tiresome
verbiage. And yet reputable business houses
every day send out letters which are almost ridiculous
because of the stiff and pompous way they
are written.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>The following letter was sent recently by one
of the oldest furniture houses in America:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p>Herewith please find receipt for full payment of your
bill. Please accept our thanks for same.</p>

<p>Relative to the commission due Mrs. Robinson would
say that if she will call at our office at her convenience we
shall be glad to pay same to her.</p>

<p>Thanking you for past favors, we beg to remain,</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Yours very truly,</p></div>

<p>Contrast that with this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Brown</span>:</p>

<p>We are returning herewith your receipted bill. Thank
you very much.</p>

<p>If you will have Mrs. Robinson call at our office at her
convenience we shall take pleasure in paying her the
commission due her.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Yours very truly,</p></div>

<p>Here is another letter so typical of the kind
that carelessness produces:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I have your letter of the 27th inst. and I have forwarded
it to Mr. Stubbs and will see him in a few days and talk
the matter over.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">
I remain<br />
    Yours sincerely,</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Would it not have been just as easy to write:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Thompson</span>:</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter of the 27th. I have forwarded
it to Mr. Stubbs and will see him in a few days

<p style="text-align: right;">Your sincerely,</p></div>

<p>In the preparation of this volume a letter of
inquiry was sent out to a number of representative
business houses all over the country. It
was a pleasure to read the excellent replies that
came in response to it. One letter reached its
destination in the midst of a strike, but the publicity
manager of the firm sent a cordial answer,
which began:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your very courteous letter to Mr. Jennings came at a
time when his mind is pretty well occupied with thoughts
concerning the employment situation in our various plants.</p>

<p>We shall endeavor, therefore, to give you such information
as comes to mind with regard to matters undertaken by
the company which have contributed to the standard of
courtesy which exists in the departments here.</p></div>

<p>We select another at random:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It pleases us very much to know that our company has
been described to you as one which practises courtesy in
business. We should like nothing better than to have all
our employees live up to the reputation credited to them by
Mr. Haight.</p>

<p>As for our methods of obtaining it&mdash;&mdash;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Contrast these two excellent beginnings with
(and this one is authentic, too):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In reply to yours of the 6th inst. relative to what part
courtesy plays in business and office management would
say that it is very important.</p></div>

<p>Routine letters must be standardized&mdash;a house
must conserve its own time as well as that of its
customers&mdash;but a routine letter must never be
used unless it adequately covers the situation.
There is no excuse for a poor routine letter, for
there is plenty of time to think it out, and there
is no excuse for sending a routine letter when it
does not thoroughly answer the correspondent's
question. The man who is answering a letter
must put himself in the place of the one who
wrote it.</p>

<p>This is a fair sample of what happens when a
letter is written by a person who either has no
imagination at all, or does not use what he has.</p>

<p>A woman who had just moved to New York
lost the key to her apartment and wrote to her
landlord for another. This answer came:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Replying to your letter, will say am sorry but it is not
the custom of the landlord to furnish more than one key
for an apartment. Should the tenant lose or misplace the
key it is up to them to replace same.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman felt a justifiable sense of irritation.
She was new to the city and thought she
was taking the most direct method of replacing
&ldquo;same.&rdquo; Perhaps she should have known better,
but she did not. Buying a key is not so simple
as buying a box of matches and to a newcomer
it is a matter of some little difficulty. She
was at least entitled to a bit more information
and to more courteous treatment than is shown
in the letter signed by his landlordly hand. She
went to see him and found him most suave and
polite (which was his habit face to face with a
woman). He explained the heavy expense of
furnishing careless tenants with new keys (which
she understood perfectly to begin with) and was
most apologetic when he discovered that she had
intended all the time to pay for it. It would
have been just as easy for him in the beginning
to write:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am sorry that I cannot send you a key, but we have
had so many similar requests that we have had to discontinue
complying with them.</p>

<p>You will find an excellent locksmith at 45 West 119
St. His telephone number is Main 3480.</p></div>

<p>Or:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am sending you the key herewith. There is a nominal
charge for it which will be added to your bill at the end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>of the month. I hope it will reach you safely. It is a
nuisance to be without one.</p></div>

<p>Imagination is indispensable to good letter
writing, but it is going rather far when one sends
thanks in advance for a favor which he expects
to be conferred. Even those who take pleasure
in granting favors like to feel that they do so of
their own free will. It takes away the pleasure
of doing it when some one asks a favor and then
assumes the thing done. Royalty alone are so
highly privileged as to have simply to voice their
wishes to have them complied with, and royalty
has gone out of fashion.</p>

<p>At one point in their journey all the travellers
in &ldquo;Pilgrim's Progress&rdquo; exchanged burdens,
but they did not go far before each one begged to
have back his original load. That is what would
happen if the man who dictates a letter were to exchange
places with his stenographer. Each would
then appreciate the position of the other, and if
they were once in a while to make the transfer in
their minds (imagination in business again) they
would come nearer the sympathetic understanding
that is the basis of good teamwork.</p>

<p>The responsibility for a letter is divided between
them, and it is important that the circumstances
under which it is written should be favor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>able.
The girl should be placed in a comfortable
position so that she can hear without
difficulty. The dictator should not smoke whether
she objects to it or not. He should have in mind
what he wants to say before he begins speaking,
and then he should pronounce his words
evenly and distinctly. He should not bang on
the desk with his fist, flourish his arms in the air,
talk in rhetorical rushes with long pauses between
the phrases, or raise his voice to a thunderous
pitch and then let it sink to a cooing murmur.
These things have not the slightest effect on the
typewritten page, and they make it very hard
for the girl to take correct notes. No one should
write a letter while he is angry, or if he writes it
(and it is sometimes a relief to write a scorching
letter) he should not mail it.</p>

<p>It is said that Roosevelt used to write very
angry letters to people who deserved them, drawing
liberally upon his very expressive supply of
abusive words for the occasion. Each time his
secretary quietly stopped the letter. Each time
the Colonel came in the day after and asked if
the letter had been sent. Each time the secretary
said, &ldquo;No, that one did not get off.&rdquo; And
each time the Colonel exclaimed, &ldquo;Good! We
won't send it!&rdquo; It came to be a regular part of
the day's routine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Inexperienced dictators will find it good practice
to have their stenographers read back their
letters so they can recast awkward sentences and
make other improvements. It can usually be
discontinued after a while, for dictating, like
nearly everything else, becomes easier with
habit.</p>

<p>A considerate man will show special forbearance
in breaking in a new girl. Different voices
are hard to grow accustomed to, and a girl who is
perfectly capable of taking dictation from one
man will find it very difficult to follow another
until she has grown used to the sound of his voice.
It is like learning a foreign language. The pupil
understands his teacher, but he does not understand
any one else until he has got &ldquo;the hang
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The training of a good stenographer does not
end when she leaves school. She should be able
not only to take down and transcribe notes
neatly and correctly. She should be able to
spell and punctuate correctly and to make the
minor changes in phrasing and diction that so
often can make a good letter of a poor one. The
most fatal disease that can overtake a stenographer
(or any one else) is the habit of slavishly
following a routine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many young fellows,&rdquo; this is from Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Ford, &ldquo;especially those employed in offices, fall
into a routine way of doing their work that eventually
makes it become like a treadmill. They
do not get a broad view of the entire business.
Sometimes that is the fault of the employer, but
that does not excuse the young man. Those who
command attention are the ones who are actually
pushing the boss.... It pays to be ahead
of your immediate job, and to do more than that
for which you are paid. A mere clock watcher
never gets anywhere. Forget the clock and
become absorbed in your job. Learn to love
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The position of secretary is a responsible one.
Frequently she knows almost as much about his
business as her employer himself (and sometimes
even more). He depends upon her quite as
much as she depends upon him, though in a somewhat
different way. It takes personal effort together
with native ability to raise any one to a
position of importance, but personal effort often
needs supplementing, and many business houses
have taken special measures to help their employees
to become good correspondents.</p>

<p>In some places there are supervisors who give
talks and discuss the actual letters, good ones
and bad, which have been written. They go
over the carbons and hold conferences with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
correspondents who need help. In other places
courtesy campaigns for a higher standard of correspondence
are held, while in others the matter
is placed in the hands of the heads of the various
departments, acting on the assumption that these
heads are men of experience and ability or they
would never have attained the position they
hold.</p>

<p>The president of a bank which has branches in
London and Paris and other big foreign cities
used every now and then to stop the boy who was
carrying a basket of carbons to the file clerk and
look them over. If he found a letter he did not
like, or one that he did like a great deal, he sent
for the person who wrote it and talked with him.
It was not necessary for him to go over the letters
often. The fact that the people in the office
knew that it was likely to happen kept them on
the alert and nearly every letter that left the organization
was better because the person who
wrote it knew that the man at the head was interested
in it and that there was a strong chance
that he might see it.</p>

<p>What is effective in one place may not be so in
another. Each house must work out its own system.
But one thing must be understood in the
beginning, and that is that the spirit of courtesy
must first abide in the home office before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
people who work there can hope to send it out
through the mail.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking there are eight types of
business letters which nearly every business man
at one time or another has to write or to consider.</p>

<p>The first is the letter of <i>application</i>. The applicant
should state simply his qualifications for
the place he wants. He should not make an
appeal to sympathy (sob stuff) nor should
he beg or cringe. He should not demand a
certain salary, though he may state what salary
he would like, and he should not say &ldquo;Salary no
object.&rdquo; It would probably not be true. There
are comparatively few people with whom money
is no object. If it is the first time the applicant
has ever tried for a position he should say so; if
not, he should give his reason for leaving his last
place. It should not be a long letter. A direct
statement of the essential facts (age, education,
experiences, etc.) is all that is necessary.</p>

<p>Many times the letter of application is accompanied
by, or calls for, a letter of <i>recommendation</i>.</p>

<p>No man should allow himself to recommend
another for qualities which he knows he does not
possess. If he is asked for a recommendation
he should speak as favorably of the person under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
consideration as he honestly can, and if his opinion
of him is disapproving he should give it with
reservations.</p>

<p>At one time during the cleaning up of Panama
there was considerable talk about displacing
General Gorgas and a committee waited on
Roosevelt to suggest another man for the job.
He listened and then asked them to get a letter
about him from Dr. William H. Welsh of Johns
Hopkins. Dr. Welsh wrote a letter praising
the man very highly, but ended by saying that
while it was true that he would be a good man for
the place, he did not think he would be as good
as the one they already had&mdash;General Gorgas.
The Colonel acted upon the letter confident
(because he had great faith in Dr. Welsh) that
he was taking the wise course, which subsequent
events proved it to be. &ldquo;Would to heaven,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that every one would write such honest
letters of recommendation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general letter of recommendation beginning
&ldquo;To whom it may concern&rdquo; is rarely given
now. It has little weight. Usually a man waits
until he has applied for a position and then gives
the name of his reference, the person to whom he
is applying writes to the one to whom he has
been referred, and the entire correspondence is
carried on between these two. In this way the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
letter of recommendation can be sincere, something
almost impossible in the open letter. It is
needless to add that all such correspondence
should be confidential.</p>

<p>The letter of <i>introduction</i> is, in a measure, a
letter of recommendation. The one who writes
it stands sponsor for the one who bears it. It
should make no extravagant claims for the one
who is introduced. He should simply be given
a chance to make good on his own responsibility.
But it should give the reason for the presentation
and suggest a way of following it up that
will result in mutual pleasure or benefit. It
should be in an unsealed envelope and the envelope
should bear, in addition to the address, the
words, &ldquo;Introducing Mr. Blank&rdquo; on the lower
left-hand corner. This does away with an embarrassing
moment when the letter is presented
in person and enables the host to greet his guest
by name and ask him to be seated while he reads
it.</p>

<p>Letters of introduction should not be given
promiscuously. Some men permit themselves
to be persuaded into giving letters of introduction
to people who are absolute nuisances (it is
hard to refuse any one who asks for this sort of
letter, but often kindest for all concerned) and
then they send in secret another letter explaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
how the first one came about. This really throws
the burden on the person who least of all ought
to bear it, the innocent man whom the first one
wanted to meet. No letter of presentation is
justified unless there is good reason behind it,
such, as for instance, in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is Mr. Franklin B. Nesbitt. He has been in Texas
for several months studying economic conditions, and I
believe can give you some valuable information which has
resulted from his research there. He is a man upon
whom you can rely. I have known him for years, and I
am sure that whatever he tells you will be trustworthy.</p></div>

<p>It is a common practice for a business man to
give his personal card with &ldquo;Introducing Mr.
Mills&rdquo; or &ldquo;Introducing Mr. Mills of Howard
and Powell Motor Co.&rdquo; written across it to a
man whom he wishes to introduce to another.
This enables him to get an interview. What he
does with it rests entirely with him.</p>

<p><i>Sales letters</i> are a highly specialized group
given over, for the most part, to experts. Their
most common fault is overstatement or patronizing.
The advertisements inserted in trade papers
and the letters sent out to the &ldquo;trade&rdquo; are
often so condescendingly written that they infuriate
the men to whom they are addressed. It
is safer to assume that the man you are writing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to is an intelligent human being. It is better to
overestimate his mentality than to underestimate
it, and it is better to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to him in the
letter than to &ldquo;write&rdquo; to him.</p>

<p>Sales letters are, as a rule, general, not personal,
and yet the best ones have the personal touch.
The letter is a silent salesman whose function is
to anticipate the needs of its customers and offer
to supply them. In this as in any other kind
of salesmanship it is the spirit which counts for
most, and the spirit of genuine helpfulness (mutual
helpfulness) gives pulling power to almost
any letter. The one which presents a special
offer on special terms specially arranged for the
benefit of the customer wins out almost every
time, provided, of course, that the offer is worth
presenting. There is no use in declaring that
all of the benefit is to the subscriber. It would
be very foolish if it were actually true. Once a
man went into a haberdashery to buy a coat.
The shop owner unctuously declared that he was
not making a cent of profit, was selling it for less
than it cost him, and so on and on. The man
walked out. &ldquo;I'll go somewhere where they have
sense enough to make a profit,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A sales letter should never be sent out to a
large group of people without first having been
tried out on a smaller one. In this way the let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ter
can be tested and improvements made before
the whole campaign is launched. The results
in the small group are a pretty fair indication of
what they will be in the large one, and a tremendous
amount of time and money can be saved by
studying the letter carefully to see where it has
failed before sending it out to make an even bigger
failure.</p>

<p>On the face of things it seems that an <i>order
letter</i> would be an easy one to write, but the mail
order houses have another story to tell. Order
blanks should be used wherever possible. They
have been carefully made and have blank spaces
for the filling in of answers to the questions
that are asked. In an order letter one should
state exactly what he wants, how he wants it
sent, and how he intends to pay for it. If the
order consists of several items, each one should
be listed separately. If they are ordered from
a catalogue they should be identified with the
catalogue description by mention of their names,
their numbers and prices. One should state
whether he is sending check, money, stamps, or
money order, but he should not say &ldquo;Enclosed
please find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The commonest form of <i>letter of acknowledgment</i>
is sent in answer to an order letter. If
there is to be the least delay in filling the order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the letter acknowledging it should say so and
should give the reason for it, but even when the
order is filled promptly (if it is a large or a comparatively
large one) the letter of acknowledgment
should be sent. Then if anything goes
wrong it is easier to trace than when the customer
has no record except the copy of his
order letter. The letter of acknowledgment
should simply thank the customer and assure him
of prompt and efficient service.</p>

<p>Complaints should be acknowledged immediately.
If there is to be a delay while an investigation
is made, the letter of acknowledgment
should simply state the fact and beg indulgence
until it is finished. Complaints should <i>always</i>
receive careful and courteous attention. Most of
them are justified, and even those that are not
had something to begin on.</p>

<p>The <i>letter of complaint</i> should never be written
hastily or angrily. It should go directly to
the root of the trouble and should state as nearly
as possible when and where and how it came
about. One should be especially careful about
placing the blame or charging to an individual
what was really the fault of an unfortunate train
of circumstances. The tone should never be
sharp, no matter how just the complaint.
&ldquo;Please&rdquo; goes further than &ldquo;Now, see here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Collection letters</i> are hardest to write. They
should appeal to a man's sense of honor first of
all. It is a cheap (and ineffective) method to
beg him to pay because you need the money, and
rarely brings any reaction except rousing in his
mind a contempt for you. The first letter in a
series (and the series often includes as many as
six or eight) should be simply a reminder. Drastic
measures should not be taken until they are
necessary, and at no time should the letters become
abrupt or insulting. In the first place, it
is ungentlemanly to write such letters, in the second
it antagonizes the debtor, and if he gets
angry enough he feels that it is hardly an obligation
to pay the money; that it will &ldquo;serve 'em
right&rdquo; if he does not do it.</p>

<p>Advertising is a sort of letter writing. Each
advertisement is a letter set before the public or
some part of the public in the hope that it will
be answered by the right person. It enters into
an over-crowded field and if it is to attract attention
it must be vivid, unusual, and convincing.
Increasingly&mdash;and there is cause to be thankful
for this&mdash;exaggerated statements are being
forced to disappear. In the first place the ballyhoo
advertisers have shouted the public deaf.
They no longer believe. In the second place advertisers
themselves have waked to the menace of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the irresponsible and dishonest people who are
advertising and are taking legal measures to
safeguard the honor of the profession.</p>

<p>One of the most successful advertisers of modern
times was a man who carried the idea of service
into everything he did. For a while he had
charge of soliciting advertising for automobile
trucks for a certain magazine. Instead of going
at it blindly he made a careful study of the map
of the United States and marked off the areas
where automobile trucks were used, where they
could be used, and where they should be used,
and sent it to the manufacturers along with a
statement of the circulation of the magazine and
the advantages of reaching the public through
it. The result was that the magazine got more
advertising from the manufacturers than it could
possibly handle. It is very gratifying to know
that this man succeeded extraordinarily as an advertiser,
for not once during his long career did
he ever try to &ldquo;put one over&rdquo; on the public or on
anybody else.</p>

<p>No advertisement should be impertinent or
importunate. During the war there was a splendid
poster bearing a picture of Uncle Sam looking
straight into your eyes and pointing his finger
straight into your face as he said, &ldquo;Young
man, your country needs you!&rdquo; The poster was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
excellent from every point of view, but since the
war, real estate companies, barber shops, restaurants
and whatnot have used posters bearing the
pictures of men pointing their fingers straight at
you saying, &ldquo;There is a home at Blankville for
you,&rdquo; &ldquo;Watch out to use Baker's Best,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;You're next!&rdquo; After all, Uncle Sam is the
only person who has a right to point his finger at
you in any such manner and say, &ldquo;I need you.&rdquo;
And besides, there is the moral side of it. Imitation
is the sincerest flattery, but the dividing
line between it and dishonesty is not always clear.
And the law cannot every time prosecute the
offender, for there is a kind of cleverness that
enables a man to pilfer the ideas of another and
recast them just sufficiently to &ldquo;get by.&rdquo; It
would be very stupid for a man not to profit by
the experience of other men, but there is a vast
difference between intelligent adaptation of ideas
and stealing them. This is more a question of
morals than of manners, for the crime&mdash;and it
is a crime&mdash;is usually deliberate, while most
breaches of manners are unintentional and due
to either carelessness or ignorance.</p>

<p>House memoranda are letters among the
various people who are working there. They
should be brief, above all things, and clear, but
never at the sacrifice of courtesy. Titles should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
not be dropped and nicknames should not be
used although initials may be. Memoranda
should never be personal unless they are sent confidentially.
An open memorandum should never
contain anything that cannot be read by every
one without reflecting unfavorably upon any one.
And it is wise to keep in mind&mdash;no matter what
you are writing&mdash;that the written record is permanent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<h3>MORALS AND MANNERS</h3>

<p>It has become a habit of late years for people
to argue at great length about right and wrong,
and what with complexes and psycho-analysis
and what with this and that, they have almost
come to the conclusion that there is no right and
wrong. Man, so they have decided, is a frail and
tender being completely at the mercy of the
traits he has inherited from his ancestors and
those he has acquired from his neighbors. What
he does is simply the result of the combination of
circumstances that have made him what he is.
There is some truth in it, of course, but what
there is is no bigger than a mustard seed, and all
the volumes that have been written about it, all
the sermons that have been preached upon it, and
all the miles of space that have been devoted to
it in the newspapers and magazines have not
served to increase it. Most of us never give any
one else credit for our achievements and there is
no more reason for giving them blame for our
failures. A gentleman is &ldquo;lord of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
actions.&rdquo; He balances his own account, and
whether there is a debit or a credit is a matter
squarely up to him.</p>

<p>The pivot upon which all right-thinking conduct
involving relations with other people turns
is the Golden Rule, &ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them.&rdquo;
It is to the moral what the sun is to the physical
world, and just as we have never made full use
of the heat and light which we derive from the
sun but could not live without that which we do
use, so we have never realized more than a small
part of the possibilities of the Golden Rule, but at
the same time could not get along together in the
world without the meagre part of it that we do
make use of. The principle is older than the
Christian Era, older than the sequoias of California,
older than the Pyramids, older than Chinese
civilization. It is the most precious abstract
truth that man has yet discovered. It contains
the germ of all that has been said and written
about human brotherhood and all that has been
done toward making it an accomplished fact.
And if to-morrow it were to vanish from the
earth we should miss it almost, if not quite, as
much as we should the sun if it were to go hurtling
off into space so far away that we could neither
see nor feel it. In the one case there would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
be no life at all on earth, in the other there would
be none worth living.</p>

<p>The Golden Rule amounts to no more than
putting yourself into another person's place. It is
not always easy to do. Half of the people in the
United States have very little idea of what the
lives of the other half are like and have no special
interest in knowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; we asked the manager of a bookshop
which caters to a large high-grade client&egrave;le, &ldquo;do
you find your greatest trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lack of imagination on the part of our customers,&rdquo;
he answered promptly, &ldquo;a total inability
to put themselves into our place, to realize
that we have our lives to live just as they have
theirs. If we haven't a book in stock they want
to know why. If we don't drop everything to
attend to them they want to know why. If anything
goes wrong they want to know why, but
they won't listen to explanations and won't accept
them when they do. They simply can't see
our side of it. And they make such unreasonable
demands. Why, last year during the Christmas
rush when the shop was fairly jammed to
the door and we were all in a perfect frenzy trying
to wait on them all, a man called up to know
if his wife was here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not always easy to see life, or even a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
section of life, from another person's point of
view. A man very often thinks housework practically
no work at all (the drudgery of it he has
never realized because he has never had to do it)
and a woman very often underestimates the wear
and tear and strain of working in an office and
getting a living out of it in competition with hundreds
of other men. Marie Antoinette had no
conception of what it meant when the French
people cried for bread. It seemed impossible to
her that a person could actually be hungry.
&ldquo;Why, give them cake!&rdquo; she exclaimed. It
may be pretty hard for a man who is making
$10,000 a year to sympathize with the stenographer
he hires for $600 or $700 a year, or for her
to see his side of things. But it is not impossible.</p>

<p>Very few of us could honestly go as far as the
novelist who recently advocated the motto: &ldquo;My
neighbor is perfect&rdquo; or the governor who set
aside a day for the people in his state to put it
into practice. We happen to know that our
neighbors are, like ourselves, astonishing compounds
of vice and virtue in whom any number
of improvements might be made. It is not necessary
to think them perfect, only to remember
that each one of us, each one of them, is entitled
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
other words, that every man has a right to a
square deal.</p>

<p>In the ancient world there were four cardinal
virtues: justice, prudence, temperance, and discretion.
In the modern world of business there
are only two. Others may follow, but these two
must come first. Justice, we mean, and kindness.
No man was ever really a gentleman who
was not just and kind, and we think it would be
almost impossible for one who is, whatever his
minor shortcomings may be, not to be a gentleman.
Just to his employees (or to his employer),
to his customers, to his friends, to
himself, and this justice always tempered with
kindness, the one quality giving the firmness necessary
in dealing with people, the other the
gentleness which is no less necessary.</p>

<p>In the first place, and this is one of the corner
stones of justice, industrial life must be made
safe for the worker. And it is a job in which he
has as large a part as the man who hires him.
Under present conditions one workman out of
every eight is injured during the year and the
accident is as often his fault as it is that of his
employer. In some instances efficient safety
devices are not provided, in others they are not
made use of.</p>

<p>Special kinds of work, such as that in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
laborer is exposed to poisonous fumes, to sand
blasts, dangerous chemicals or mineral dusts,
need special protective devices and men with
sense enough to use them. The employer cannot
do his share unless the worker does his, and
the worker is too quick to take a chance. The
apprentice is usually cautious enough, but the
old hand grows unwary. Ninety-nine times he
thrusts his arm in among belts whirling at lightning
speed and escapes, but the hundredth time
the arm is caught and mangled. And there is
nothing to blame but his own carelessness.</p>

<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>

<p>I am more powerful than the combined armies
of the world.</p>

<p>I have destroyed more men than all the wars
of the nations.</p>

<p>I am more deadly than bullets, and I have
wrecked more homes than the mightiest of siege
guns.</p>

<p>I steal, in the United States, alone, over
$300,000,000 each year.</p>

<p>I spare no one, and I find my victims among
the rich and poor alike, the young and old, the
strong and weak. Widows and orphans know me.</p>

<p>I loom up to such proportions that I cast my
shadow over every field of labor, from the turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>ing
of the grindstone to the moving of every railroad
train.</p>

<p>I massacre thousands upon thousands of wage
earners a year.</p>

<p>I lurk in unseen places and do most of my
work silently. You are warned against me but
you heed not.</p>

<p>I am relentless.</p>

<p>I am everywhere&mdash;in the house, on the streets,
in the factory, at the railroad crossings, and on
the sea.</p>

<p>I bring sickness, degradation and death, and
yet few seek to avoid me.</p>

<p>I destroy, crush or maim; I give nothing but
take all.</p>

<p>I am your worst enemy.</p>

<h3>I AM CARELESSNESS</h3>

<p>Any kind of carelessness which results in injury
(or is likely to result in it), whether the injury
is mental or physical, is criminal. No
plea can justify building a theatre which cannot
stand a snowstorm, a school which cannot give
a maximum of safety to the children who are in
it, a factory which does not provide comfortable
working conditions for the people employed
there, or allowing any unsafe building or part of
a building to stand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a factory (this story is true) which
places the lives of the majority of its employees
in jeopardy twice a day. There are two sets of
elevators, one at the front of the building for
the executives and their secretaries and visitors,
one at the rear for the rank and file of the employees.
Since there are several hundred of the
latter the advantages of the division are too obvious
to need discussion. We have no quarrel
with it. But the apparatus upon which the elevators
in the rear run is so old and so rotten and
so rusty that there is constant danger of its
breaking down. Three times already there have
been serious accidents. The men who are hired
to operate the cars rarely stay more than a week
or so. Protests have been sent in but nothing
has been done. The management knows what the
conditions are but they have never stopped to
realize the horror of it. It is not that they
value a few dollars more than they do human life,
but that they simply do not stop to think or to
imagine what it would be like to have to ride in
the ramshackle elevator themselves. In the offices
of this factory there is an atmosphere of
courtesy and good breeding far beyond the ordinary&mdash;in
justice to the people there it must be
said that they do not know the conditions in the
rear, but the management does. And the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>agement
is polite in most of its dealings, both
with its employees and outside, but polish laid
over a cancerous growth like this is not courtesy.</p>

<p>There are three essentials for good work: <i>good
lighting</i> (it must be remembered that a light
that is too glaring is as bad as one that is too
dim), <i>fresh air</i> (air that is hot and damp or dry
and dusty is not fresh), and <i>cleanliness</i> (clean
workrooms&mdash;and workers&mdash;clean drinking water
with individual drinking cups, and in places
where the work is unusually dirty, plenty of
clean water for bathing purposes.)</p>

<p>In the matter of salaries&mdash;economically one of
the most important questions in the world&mdash;the
employer should pay, not as little, but as much
as he can afford. No man has a right to hire a
girl (or a boy either) at less than a living wage
and expect her to live on it. The pitiless publicity
which was given the evil of hiring girls at
starvation wages some years ago (in particular
through the short stories of O. Henry, &ldquo;the little
shop-girl's knight&rdquo; which, according to Colonel
Roosevelt, suggested all the reforms which he
undertook in behalf of the working girls of New
York) did much in the way of reform, but there
is much yet to be done.</p>

<p>Money has been called the root of all evil. It
is not money, but greed. Greed and thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>lessness.
Sir James Barrie says stupidity and
jealousy, but both these might be included under
thoughtlessness. Men who are generous almost
to a fault when a case of individual need is
brought before them will hire girls at less than
any one could exist on in decency. When they
meet these same girls in the hall or when they
come directly into contact with them in their
work they may be polite enough, but their politeness
is not worth a tinker's curse. Justice must
come first. Only if the employer pays a fair
day's wage can he expect a fair day's work.
&ldquo;Even then,&rdquo; he protests, &ldquo;I can't get it.&rdquo; And
this is, unfortunately, in large measure true. As
Kipling said some few years ago, and it still
holds,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From forge and farm and mine and bench<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deck, altar, outpost lone&mdash;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I can't even get them here on time,&rdquo; the employer's
wail continues. The employee may
respond that the employer is not there, but this
has nothing to do with it. Most people are paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
to get to their work at a certain hour. They
have a daily appointment with their business at
a specified time. It is wise and honorable to
keep it. Tardiness is a habit, and, like most
others, considerably harder to break than to
form, but punctuality also is a habit, not quite
so easy to establish as tardiness because it is
based on strength while the other is based on
weakness. Most of us hate to get up in the
morning, but it is good discipline for the soul,
and we have the words of poets as well as of
business men that</p>

<p>Time is one of the most valuable of commodities.
More people are discharged for coming in
late than for any other reason, not excepting (we
believe this no exaggeration) &ldquo;lay-offs&rdquo; during
dull seasons. Slipping out before the regular
time and soldiering on the job fall into the same
classification with tardiness. Such practices the
employee too often looks upon as a smart way of
getting around authority, blithely ignoring the
fact which has so many times been called to our
attention: that what a man does to a job is not
half so important as what the job does to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
The material loss which comes from it is the least
of its harms.</p>

<p>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,
but he is duller yet if he tries to mix them. Intense
concentration during working hours followed
by complete rest is the only way to make a
contented workman, and it is the happy workman
(just as it is the happy warrior), in spite of
all that is said about divine discontent, who
counts for most both to himself and to his community.
There is a gladness about earnest
eager work which is hard to find in anything
else. &ldquo;I know what pleasure is,&rdquo; declared Robert
Louis Stevenson, &ldquo;because I have done good
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gossiping, idling, smoking, writing personal
letters during working hours (these usually on
the firm's stationery), and a thousand and one
other petty acts of dishonesty are ruinous, not so
much to the house which tolerates them (because
it cannot help itself) as to the person who commits
them. Telephones are the cause of a good
deal of disturbance during business hours in
places where employees spend an appreciable
amount of time on personal calls. In some organizations
they are prohibited altogether; but
in most they are allowed if not carried to excess.
It is not business people who need education in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
this so much as their friends who have never been
in business and seem unable to realize that personal
calls are not only annoying, but time-killing
and distracting.</p>

<p>Part of the unrest and unhappiness among
employees is due to the fact that vast numbers of
them are working not at what they want to do
but at what they have to do, marking time until
they can get something better. It is very commendable
for a man to be constantly watching
out to improve himself, but it does not in the
meanwhile excuse him from doing his best at the
job for which he is drawing pay. It is dishonest.
It is unsportsmanlike. It is unmanly.</p>

<p>The question of salary is, from whatever
angle it is approached, a delicate one. &ldquo;My experience
is,&rdquo; observed David Harum, &ldquo;that most
men's hearts is located ruther closter to their
britchis pockets than they are to their vest pockets.&rdquo;
It is a tender subject, and one that causes
more trouble than almost any other in the world.
Employees who are trusted with the payroll
should not divulge figures and employees who
are on the payroll should not discuss and compare
salaries. Jones cannot understand why
Brown gets more than he does when he knows
that Brown's work is not so good, Brown cannot
see why Smith gets as much as he does when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
is out two or three days in the week, and Smith
cannot see why he has not been made an executive
after all the years he has worked in the place.
There are many sides to the matter of salary adjustment
and they all have to be taken into consideration.
And the petty jealousies that
employees arouse by matching salaries against
one another only serve to make a complex problem
more difficult.</p>

<p>There is only one base upon which a man
should rest his plea for an increase in salary, and
that is good work. The fact that he has a family
dependent upon him, that he is ill or hard up may
be ample reason for giving him financial help or
offering him a loan, but it is no reason why his
salary should be increased unless his work deserves
it. Paternalism is more unfair than most
systems of reward, and the man who comes whimpering
with a tale of hard luck is usually (but
not always) not worth coddling. Years of experience,
even though they stretch out to three
score and ten, are not in themselves sufficient
argument for promotion. Sometimes the mere
fact that a man has been content to stay in one
place year after year shows that he has too little
initiative to rise in that particular kind of work
and is too timid to try something else.</p>

<p>Another big cause of trouble among men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
working in the same organization is rigid class
distinction. When a man hires others to work
<i>for</i> him he invites discontent; when he hires them
to work <i>with</i> him there may be dissatisfaction,
but the chances of it are lessened. A business
well knit together is like any other group, an
army or a football team, bound into a unit to
achieve a result. At its best each person in it
feels a responsibility toward each one of the
others; each realizes that who a man is is not half
so important as what he does, and that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... the game is more than the player of the game<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the ship is more than the crew,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or, as another poet with a Kiplingesque turn of
mind and phrase has it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is not the guns or armament<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or the money they can pay.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That makes them win the day.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But the everlastin' team work<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of every blooming soul.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Each man is directly responsible to his immediate
superior. He should never, unless the
circumstances are unusual, go over his head and
he should never do so without letting him know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
It should be impossible, and is, in a well-organized
house, for men coming from the outside to
appeal over a member of a firm. Responsible
men should be placed in the contact positions and
their responsibility should be respected. Salesmen
are warned not to bother with the little
fellow but to go straight to the head of a firm.
Like most general advice, it is dangerous to put
into universal practice. The heads of most
firms have men to take care of visitors, and in
a good many instances, the salesman helps his
cause by going to the proper subordinate in the
first place. It is all very well to go to the head
of a firm but to do it at the expense of the dignity
of one of the smaller executives is doubtful business
policy and doubtful ethics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Passing the buck&rdquo; is a gentle vice practised
in certain loosely hung together concerns. It
is a strong temptation to shift the accountability
for a mistake to the shoulders of the person on
the step below, but it is to be remembered that
temptations, like obstacles, are things to be overcome.
The &ldquo;buck,&rdquo; as has been pointed out,
always passes down and not up, a fact which
makes a detestable practice all the more odious.
One of the first laws of knighthood was to defend
the weak and to protect the poor and helpless;
it still holds, though knighthood has passed out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of existence; and the creature (he is not even
good red herring) who blames some one else for a
fault of his, or allows him to take the blame, is
beneath contempt.</p>

<p>When a mistake has been made and the responsibility
fixed on the right person the penalty
may be inflicted. If it is a scolding or a &ldquo;bawling
out&rdquo; it should be done quietly. Good managers
do not shout their reprimands. They do
not need to. The reproof for a fault is a matter
between the offender and the &ldquo;boss.&rdquo; No one
else has any concern with it, and there is no
reason why the instinct for gossip or the appetite
for malicious reports on the part of the other
employees should be satisfied. The world would
be happier and business would be infinitely more
harmonious if each person in it could realize that
his chief aim in life should be to mind his own
business or, at least, to let other people's alone.</p>

<p>Private secretaries and other people in more
or less confidential positions are many times
tempted to give away secret information, not so
much for the benefit of the person to whom it is
given as to show how much they themselves are
trusted. Nearly every one who holds a responsible
business position receives items of information
which are best not repeated, and if common
sense does not teach him what should be kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
private and what should be told, nothing will.
It should not be necessary for the superior to
preface each of his remarks with, &ldquo;Now, this
must go no further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matters concerning salaries should always be
confidential, and so should personal items such
as health reports, character references, and so
on, credit reports, blacklists, and other information
of a similar nature. It is compiled for a
definite purpose and for the use of a limited
group of people. It is unethical to use it in
any other way.</p>

<p>The reason for dismissing a person from a
business organization should be kept private,
especially if it is something that reflects unfavorably
on his character. But the reason should
<i>always</i> be given to the employee himself. He
may not listen, and most of the men who have
had experience in hiring and firing say that he
will not, but that is his own responsibility. The
employer has no right to let him go without letting
him know why. And the employee should
listen&mdash;it may not be his fault but he should
check up honestly with himself and find out.
The same thing that lost him this place may
lose him another, and a good many times all that
he can get out of being discharged is a purification
of soul. It is a pity if he misses that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Discharging a person is a serious matter, serious
from both sides, and it is not a thing to be
done lightly. Most houses try to obviate it in so
far as possible by hiring only the kind of people
they want to keep. &ldquo;Our efforts toward efficiency&rdquo;
(we quote from one manager who is typical
of thousands) &ldquo;begin at the front door. We
try to eliminate the unfit there. We do not employ
any one who happens to come along. We try
by means of an interview and references and psychological
tests to get the very highest type of
employee.&rdquo; No human test is perfect, however,
and there are times, even in the best regulated
houses, when it becomes necessary to dismiss
persons who have shown themselves unfit.</p>

<p>It is not always a disgrace to be discharged
and it is not always a step downward. It may
be because of business depression or it may be
because the man is a square peg in a round hole.
Sometimes it is the only experience that will reduce
a man's, especially a young man's, idea of
his own importance to something like normal
proportions, the only one that will clear his mind
of the delusion that he is himself the only person
who is keeping off the rocks the business for
which he is working, in which case it is one of the
best things that could have happened to him.</p>

<p>A roll call of famous or successful men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
were fired would take up several reams of paper,
and it is a pretty rash personnel manager (not
to say brutal and unfair) who will throw a man
out like a rotten potato and declare that he is
absolutely no good. Besides, he does not know.
All that he can be sure of is that the man was
not qualified for the job he was holding. And
he should think twice before giving a man a
bad name even if he feels certain that he deserves
it. At the same time he must protect himself
and other business men from incompetent, weak,
or vicious employees. If after his dismissal a
man sends back to his former employer for a
recommendation, the recommendation should be
as favorable as possible without sacrificing the
truth.</p>

<p>When a man breaks his connection with a
business house, whether he does so voluntarily
or involuntarily, his departure should be pleasant,
or at the least dignified. It is childish to
take advantage of the fact that you are going
away to tell all of the people you have grudges
against how you feel about them, and it is worse
than a mere breach of good manners to abuse
the house that has asked you to leave. If it
has done some one else an injustice, talk about
that all you please, but on your own account be
silent. Even if the fault has been altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
with the house it does not help to call it names.
Self-respect should come to the rescue here. This
is the time when it is right to be too proud to
fight.</p>

<p>For a long time it has been held bad ethics for
the members of one trade or profession to speak
disparagingly of their competitors, and we have
grown accustomed to say that you can judge a
man by the way he speaks of his rivals. This
has limits, however, and in some instances a mistaken
idea of loyalty to one's calling has led to
the glossing over of certain evils which could
have been cured much earlier if they had been
made public. It is all very well to be generous
and courteous toward one's competitors but the
finest courtesy in any business consists of doing
whatever tends to elevate the standard of that
business.</p>

<p>Every man likes his business to be well thought
of, and most businesses have organized for
the promotion of a high standard of ethics
as well as for the development of more efficient
methods. Notable among these, to mention one
of the most recent ones, is the Advertisers' Association.
There was a time when the whole profession
was menaced by the swindlers who were
exploiting fraudulent schemes by means of
advertising in magazines and newspapers, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to-day no reputable periodical will accept an
advertisement without investigating its source
and most of them will back up the guarantee of
the advertiser that his goods are what he represents
them to be with a guarantee of their own.
No publication which intends to keep alive can
afford a reputation of dishonesty, and the efforts
of the publishers toward cleaning up have been
seconded by the association to such an extent that
any person or corporation that issues a deceptive
advertisement, whether or not there was intent
to deceive, will be prosecuted and punished.</p>

<p>There was a time when a man could do almost
anything within the law in a commercial transaction
and excuse himself by saying &ldquo;business is
business.&rdquo; Happily this is no longer true.
Business men have not grown perfect but they
have raised their standards of business morality
as high as their standards of personal morality.
They have learned that business and life are one,
that our lives cannot&mdash;and this has a number of
disadvantages&mdash;be separated into compartments
like so many tightly corked bottles on a shelf.
We have only one vessel and whatever goes into
it colors what is already there. And it is significant
to remember that muddy water poured
into clean water will make it muddy, but that
clean water poured into muddy water will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
make it clean. It takes very little ink in a pail
of milk to color the whole of it, but it takes an
enormous amount of milk to have any effect on
a bottle of ink.</p>

<p>Business men have also learned that the only
way to build a business that will last is to lay its
foundation on the Golden Rule, and many a man
who might otherwise sidetrack the principles of
integrity holds by them for this reason. &ldquo;Honesty,&rdquo;
declared one of the most insufferable prigs
America ever produced, &ldquo;is the best policy.&rdquo; He
was right. Prigs usually are. It is only because
they are so sure of it themselves that they
irritate us.</p>

<p>It is a fact, in spite of the difficulty Diogenes
had when he took up his lantern and set out to
find an honest man, that most people like to pay
their way as they go, and the business men who
recognize this are the ones who come out on top.
They do not say that the customer is always right
nor that he is perfect, but they assume that he is
honest and trust him until he has proved himself
otherwise. The biggest mail order house in
America never questions a check. As soon as
an order is received they fill it and attend to the
check afterward. Their percentage of loss is
extraordinarily small. Distrust begets distrust,
and the perversity of human nature is such that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
even an honest man will be tempted to cheat if
he knows another suspects him of it. The converse
is equally true. There are, of course, exceptions.
But the only rule in the world to
which there are no exceptions is that there is no
rule that holds good under all conditions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<h3>&ldquo;BIG BUSINESS&rdquo;</h3>

<p>In the preceding pages we have looked over
the field of etiquette in business in a general
way, and have come to the only conclusion possible,
namely, that the basis of courtesy in business
is common sense, and that whatever rules
may be given must not be followed slavishly, but
must simply be used as guide posts. In the
pages which follow we shall go into detail and
watch courtesy at work among certain groups
and individuals.</p>

<p>Let us take, for example, a big concern which
employs a thousand or more people. We shall
begin with the president.</p>

<p><i>President of a Big Organization.</i> Here is a
man who bears a heavy responsibility. He has
not only his own welfare to look after but that of
the men and women who work <i>with</i> (we like this
word better than <i>for</i>) him. His first duty is to
them. How can he best perform it?</p>

<p>It is a matter of fact that few men rise to such
positions who are not innately courteous. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
one of the qualities which enable them to rise.
For this reason we shall take it for granted that
the president needs no instructions. Already he
has learned the great value of courtesy. But
this does not protect him always from discourtesy
in other people.</p>

<p>Every man who holds a high position in a big
organization is besieged with visitors, but no one
so much as the president. He is a target for
cranks and idlers and freaks as well as for earnest
business men who want to help him or to get
help from him. Thousands during the course of
a year come to call on him. If he saw them all
he would have to turn over the presidency to
some one else and devote himself to entertaining
visitors. Many of those who come ask for him
when he is not at all the man they want to see,
but they have been taught in the schools of salesmanship
or they have read in a magazine that it
never pays to bother with the little fellow, but
that they should go straight to the top.</p>

<p>Every minute of the time of the president
of a big company is valuable (all time is valuable,
as far as that goes), and it must be protected
from the people who have no right to infringe
upon it.</p>

<p>You would think that the vice-presidents and
the managers and the various executives would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
be his best protection. They are not. It is the
person who is placed at the front door to receive
visitors. We shall consider him next.</p>

<p><i>The Man at the Door.</i> As a matter of fact,
this person is usually a girl, many times a very
young and irresponsible one, because great numbers
of business men have not yet realized the importance
of the position. A well-poised girl or
a woman who has had wide experience in handling
people can fill the place quite as efficiently
as a man, and a great deal more so if the man has
not been chosen because he has the quick sympathy
and ready tact so necessary in taking care of
the needs of a miscellaneous assortment of callers.</p>

<p>In the house we are observing the person at
the door is a young man who began as a messenger
boy, and who, because he did what he was
asked to do cheerfully instead of sullenly, with a
&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; and a smile instead of a &ldquo;That's
Bob's business&rdquo; and a frown, was made manager
of the messengers, and then first assistant of the
man at the door, and later, when that man was
given another position, was promoted to his
place. The job commands a good salary and
offers chances of promotion. The young man
likes it.</p>

<p>A visitor comes, a young salesman, let us say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
who has had little experience. This is only the
second or third time he has tried to storm the
doors of big business. He asks at once for the
president. He does not give his card because
the school where he learned his trade cautioned
him against doing so. (He is perfectly correct,
and he would have been equally correct if he had
given it. The more formal style is to send in
the card.) The man at the door sees at once
what kind of man he has to deal with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The president is busy,&rdquo; he answers&mdash;a safe remark
always, because if he is not he should be;
&ldquo;maybe I can do something for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The salesman explains that he has an attachment
to increase efficiency of typewriters. He
would like to show the president how it works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don't want Mr. President,&rdquo; the host
answers. &ldquo;You want Mr. Jones. He attends
to all such things for us. Will you be seated
here in the reception room,&rdquo; motioning toward
the door which is at one side of his desk, &ldquo;while I
find out if he is busy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This concern is very conservative about buying
new attachments and new machinery of any kind,
but it is ever on the alert to discover means of increasing
its output and saving its manpower.
Almost any new idea is worth a demonstration.</p>

<p>If the man at the desk has an intelligent mes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>senger
boy&mdash;and he should have&mdash;he sends him
in to Mr. Jones. The boy finds Mr. Jones busy.
He will be free in about fifteen minutes and then
will be glad to see the salesman. The man reports
to the visitor and asks if he cares to wait.
He does. The host offers him a magazine and
asks him to make himself comfortable while he
goes back to his desk to attend to the next visitor.</p>

<p>This one also wants to see the president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The president is in conference just now,&rdquo;
the young man replies. &ldquo;Perhaps there is something
I can do for you in the meanwhile if you
will tell me what you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's none of your business,&rdquo; he answers
rudely. &ldquo;I want the president.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chances are against a man of this sort.
He may be a person the president wants to see,
but the odds are ten to one that he is not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry but you cannot possibly see him
now. He is busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will he be free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard to tell. These conferences sometimes
last an hour or two, and I am sure he will
not see you even then unless you tell him why
you want to see him. He is a very busy man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor sputters around a few minutes and
it develops that he is selling insurance. The
young man knows that the president will not see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
him under any circumstances. He is already
heavily insured, as every wise man should be,
and he cannot be bothered with agents who are
trying to sell him larger policies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; the young man repeats, &ldquo;but I
am sure there is no use in letting him waste your
time. He is already carrying a heavy policy
and he positively refuses to talk insurance with
anyone, no matter who it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This should be enough for the salesman. What
the young man says is true. It would be a waste
of his time as well as the president's. He does
not care half so much for the salesman's time&mdash;there
is no reason why he should&mdash;but notice how
tactfully he tells him that the head of the organization
has no time to spend with him.</p>

<p>There is a certain rough type of salesman (we
use the word salesman here in the broadest sense,
as the salesmen themselves use it, to cover all the
people who are trying to convince some one else
that what they have is worth while whether it is
an idea or a washing machine or a packet of
drawings)&mdash;there is a certain rough type of
salesman who tries to bluster his way through.
He never lasts long as a salesman, though unfortunately
he survives a good many years in
various kinds of business. Even he must not be
turned away rudely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; the young man says to a person
of this sort, &ldquo;but the president has given positive
orders that he must not be disturbed this
morning. He is engaged in a very important
transaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next man who approaches the door has an
authentic claim on the president. It would be
as great a calamity to turn him away as it would
be to let some of the others in. He presents his
card and says that he has an appointment. A
truly courteous man, whenever possible, arranges
an appointment beforehand. The young
man takes the card, waves toward the reception
room, and asks him to be seated while he finds out
if the president is busy. He telephones to the
secretary of the president, tells him who is calling,
and asks if the president is ready to see him.
If the answer is affirmative he asks if he will see
him in his office or out in the reception room.
It is much easier to get rid of a visitor from the
entrance hall or reception room than from an inside
office. If he says that he will see him in
the reception room the girl reports to the visitor
that he will come in a few minutes, offers him a
magazine, and asks him to make himself at home.
If the president says that he will see the visitor
in his office the young man sends one of the messenger
boys to usher him through the building.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it may be that this man had no appointment
with the president, but that he has used it
as a pretext to break through. In this case, the
secretary answers, after consulting his schedule,
that the president has never heard of such a person
and has no such appointment. A man of
this sort is not worth a minute's consideration.
He has shown himself dishonest at the outset
with a petty contemptible dishonesty, and the
temptation is to pitch him out on his head. But
the young man says quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;His secretary says that the president has no
appointment with you. I am afraid you have
come to the wrong place. It must be some
other Mr. Beacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a note of finality in his voice which
convinces the visitor that there is no use in going
further.</p>

<p>The next visitor is a woman who has come to
have lunch with a friend of hers who works in
the accounting department.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is fifteen minutes before time for lunch,&rdquo;
the young man answers. &ldquo;I can call her now,
of course, but if you would rather not disturb
her, I'll tell her that you will wait for her in the
reception room until she comes for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman thanks him and agrees that it will
be much better not to disturb her. The young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
man offers her a chair and a magazine and invites
her to make herself comfortable.</p>

<p>It grows monotonous in the telling for him to
ask each of the visitors exactly the same questions
(never exactly the same, of course) in the
same cordial tone of voice and to tell them to
make themselves comfortable in exactly the same
way, but the means of attaining success in such
a place lies in the fact that he greets each visitor
as if he were the only one he had to attend to,
and that he is, for the time being, at least, completely
at the visitor's service. It is not so much
what the young man says as the way he says it.
&ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; can be spoken in such a way
that it is an insult.</p>

<p><i>The Girl at the Telephone.</i> It is nerve-racking
to stand at the door to receive callers,
but it is much more so to sit at the switchboard
and receive messages. The only point of contact
is through the voice, but it is remarkable
how much of one's personality the voice expresses.
If you are tired your voice shows it;
if you are cross your voice tells it; if you are
worried, your voice betrays it. It is possible for
one (everyone) to cultivate a pleasing voice.
The telephone companies have learned this, and
there is no part of her equipment upon which
they spend more time and effort than on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
voice of the telephone girl. It is interesting to
know that their very excellent motto, &ldquo;The voice
with the smile wins&rdquo; did not spring into being
without thought. On the early bulletins this
clumsy phrase was printed: &ldquo;A smiling voice
facilitates service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl at the telephone, even though she receives
a thousand calls a day, must answer each
one pleasantly and patiently. Some people call
without a very clear idea of what they want, and
the fact that business houses have so many different
names for exactly the same job often makes
it difficult for them to locate the person they are
asking for, even when they are fairly sure who it
is they want.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I speak to your personnel manager?&rdquo;
comes the query over the wire to a girl who has
never heard of a personnel manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry, I did not quite hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person at the other end repeats the word
and the girl is sure she had it right the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no personnel manager here. Maybe
there is some one else who would do. If you will
tell me what you want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, please, I'll connect you with
our employment manager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Advertising engineers, executive secretaries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and many others are old jobs masquerading
under new names.</p>

<p>More business men complain of the girl at the
telephone than of any other person in business.
She must, under the handicap of distance, accomplish
exactly what the man at the door does,
and must do it as efficiently and as courteously.</p>

<p>No matter how angry the one who is calling
becomes, no matter how profane he may be, no
matter what he says, she must not answer back,
and she must not slam the receiver down while
he is talking. Perfect poise, an even temper,
patience, and a pleasant voice under control&mdash;if
she has these, and a vast number of the telephone
girls have, she need not worry about the
rules of courtesy. They will take care of themselves.</p>

<p>The numbers that a girl in a business office
has to call frequently she should have on a pad
or card near the switchboard so that she will
not have to look them up. Many business men
ask the girl at the board to give them Blank and
Blank or Smith and Smith instead of giving her
the numbers of the two concerns. She then has
to look them up, quite a difficult task when one
has the headpiece on and calls coming in and
going out every minute. To stop to look up one
number often delays several, and it is a duty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which should never devolve upon the girl whose
business it is to send the calls through. The
man who is calling, or his secretary, if he has one,
or a person near the switchboard stationed there
for the purpose should look up the numbers and
give them to the operator.</p>

<p>An efficient girl at the telephone sends numbers
through as quickly as is humanly possible,
but even then she is often scolded by nervous and
harassed men who expect more than can really
be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter has called Main 6785. It is busy.
He waits. Hours pass. At least it seems so to
him, and he grows impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter with that number, Miss
Fisher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm still trying, Mr. Hunter. I'll call you
when they answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The line continues busy. Mr. Hunter looks
over the papers on his desk. His nervousness
increases. He takes down the receiver again
and asks what the trouble is. He does not get
the number any more quickly this way, but it
would be hard to convince him that he does not.
The girl says quietly again that she is still trying.
He clings to the receiver and in a few
minutes she answers triumphantly, &ldquo;Here they
are,&rdquo; and the connection is made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The telephone girl in a big concern (or a little
one) is constantly annoyed with people who have
the wrong number. When it happens ten or
twelve times in the course of a day&mdash;fortunately
it is not usually so often&mdash;it is hard for her to
keep a grip on her temper and answer pleasantly,
&ldquo;This is not the number you want,&rdquo; but
the snappish answer always makes a bad situation
worse, and the loss of temper which causes
it drains the energy of the person who makes it.
It is not merely the voice with the smile that
wins; it is the disposition and temperament to
which such a voice is the index.</p>

<p><i>The Secretary.</i> The next in the line of defense
is the president's secretary. To him (and
we use the masculine pronoun although this position,
like a good many others, is often held by
women even in the biggest organizations, where
the responsibility attached to it is by no means
small)&mdash;to him the president turns over the details
of his day's work. He arranges the president's
schedule and reminds him of the things
he has forgotten and the things he is likely to
forget. He receives all of his visitors by telephone
first and many times disposes of their
wants without having to connect them with the
president at all. He receives many of the callers
who are admitted by the man at the door and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in the same way often takes care of them without
disturbing the president. He knows more
about the petty routine of the job than the president
himself. He is accurate. He is responsible.
He is patient. He is courteous.</p>

<p>In order that he may be all these things it is
necessary for the president to keep him well informed
as to what he is doing and where he is
going and what he is planning so that he can
give intelligent answers to the people who come,
so that he can keep things running smoothly
when the president is away, so that he can
answer without delay when the president asks
whether he has a luncheon engagement on
Thursday, and what he did with the memorandum
from the circulation manager, and who is
handling the shipping sheets.</p>

<p>Men who have their minds on larger matters
cannot keep all the details of their jobs in mind,
but it is significant to know that most successful
business men know with more than a fair degree
of accuracy what these details amount to. Some
secretaries feel very superior to the men who employ
them because they can remember the date
on which the representatives of the Gettem Company
called and the employers cannot. The
author knows a chauffeur who drives for a
famous New York surgeon who thinks himself a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
much better man than the surgeon because he
can remember the numbers of the houses where
his patients and his friends live and the surgeon
cannot. The author also knows a messenger
boy who thinks himself a much bigger man than
one of the most successful brokers in Wall Street
because the broker sometimes gives him the same
message twice within fifteen minutes, the second
time after it has already been delivered.</p>

<p>The secretary comes to the office every morning
neatly clad and on time. The hour at which
his employer comes in has nothing to do with
him. There is a definite time at which he is expected
to be at his desk. He is there.</p>

<p>He opens the letters on his desk&mdash;and those
addressed to the president come first to him&mdash;and
sorts them, throwing aside the worthless
advertising matter, saving that which may be of
some interest, marking the letters that are to
be referred to various other members of the
house, and placing them in the memorandum basket,
piling into one heap those that he cannot answer
without first consulting the president, and
into another those which must be answered by the
president personally. Intimately personal letters
often come mixed in with the rest of the
mail. No man wants a secretary whom he cannot
trust even with letters of this sort, but almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
any secretary worth having will feel a certain
amount of delicacy in opening them unless he is
requested to do so. When these letters are from
people who write often the secretary grows to
recognize the handwriting from the outside of
the envelope, and therefore does not need to open
them. In other cases it is sometimes possible to
distinguish a personal from a business letter.
These should be handled according to the wishes
of the man to whom they are directed. Many
business men turn practically everything&mdash;even
the settlement of their family affairs&mdash;over to
their secretaries. It is a personal matter, and
the secretary's part in it is to carry out the wishes
of his employer.</p>

<p>By the time the mail is sorted the president
has come in.</p>

<p>He rings for his secretary, telephones for him,
sends a messenger for him, or else goes to his
desk himself and asks him to come in and take
dictation. There is no special courtesy or discourtesy
in any of these methods. It depends
on how far apart the desks are, how busy he is,
and a number of other things. He does not yell
for his secretary to come in. He manages to
get him there quietly. It is not necessary for
him to rise when the secretary enters (even if the
secretary is a woman) though he may do so (and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
it is a very gracious thing, especially if the secretary
is a woman) but he should greet him (or
her) with a pleasant &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The secretary takes his place in the comfortable
chair that has been provided for him, with
notebook and pencil in hand and at least one
pencil in reserve. He waits for the president to
begin, and listens closely so that he may transcribe
as rapidly as he speaks. If he fails to
understand he waits until they come to the end
of a sentence before asking his employer to repeat.
It is much better to do so then than to depend
on puzzling it out later or coming back and
asking him after he has forgotten what was said.</p>

<p>Telephone interruptions and others may come
during the dictation but the secretary waits until
he is dismissed or until the pile of letters has disappeared.</p>

<p>When the president has finished it is the secretary's
time to begin talking. He consults him
about the various letters upon which he needs his
advice and makes notations in shorthand on
them. He reports on the various calls that have
come in and the house memoranda. A good
secretary reads and digests these before turning
them over to his employer, and in most cases
gives the gist of the memorandum instead of the
memorandum itself. It saves time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The president's secretary usually has a secretary
of his own, a woman, let us say, or a girl
whose preliminary training has been good and
whose record for the year and a half she has been
with the company has been excellent.</p>

<p>She comes to her desk on time every morning
as fresh as a daisy and as inconspicuous. The
relation that she bears to the president's secretary
is much the same as the relation that he
bears to the president. She gets the letters
that are addressed to him and sorts them in the
same way that he does those of the president.
On days when he is absent she takes care of all
of his work, in so far as she is able, as well as her
own.</p>

<p>Her employer is considerate of her always.
He does not make a practice of taking ten or fifteen
minutes of her lunch hour or five or ten
minutes overtime at the close of the day, but
when there is a good reason why he should ask
her to remain he does so, asking courteously if
she would mind staying. If she is genuinely
interested in her work&mdash;and this young lady is&mdash;she
will stay, but if she has an even better reason
why she should go she explains briefly that it is
impossible to stay. He never imposes heavier
burdens upon her than she can bear, but he does
not hesitate to ask her to do whatever needs to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
done, and he does it with a &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Thank
you,&rdquo; and not with a &ldquo;See, here&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Say,
listen to me, now.&rdquo; She is a very pretty and
attractive girl, but the man she is working for is
a gentleman. To him she is his secretary, and
if he were ever in danger of forgetting it she
would be quick to remind him. She does not go
around with a chip on her shoulder all the time,
and she talks freely with the various men around
the office just as she does with the women and
girls, but it is in an impersonal way. She never
permits intimate attentions from her immediate
employer or any one else.</p>

<p><i>Executives.</i> &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; is a large, loose
word which rolls smoothly off the tongue of far
too many business men to-day. Office boys begin
to think in terms of it before they are out of
knee trousers. &ldquo;I could hold down the job,&rdquo;
said a youngster who had hurt his hand and
whose business was to carry a bag of mail from
a suburban factory into New York, &ldquo;if I could
get some one to carry the bag.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can do the
work,&rdquo; say smart young men in the &ldquo;infant
twenties&rdquo; (and many others&mdash;there is no age
limit), &ldquo;but I must have a man to look after the
details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The way to an executive position is through
details. Work, plain hard work, is the founda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>tion
of every enduring job, and the executive
who thinks he can do without it has a sharp reckoning
day ahead. In most places the executives
have worked their way up slowly, and at no time
along the way have they had that large contempt
for small jobs which characterizes so many young
men in business. They have been perfectly willing
to do whatever came to hand.</p>

<p>But after all this is said, the fact remains that
an executive is successful not so much because of
his own ability as because of his power to recognize
ability in other men. He is&mdash;and this is
true of every executive from the president down&mdash;the
servant of his people in much the same way
that the President of the United States is the
servant of the American people. This means
that he must be readily accessible to them, and
must listen as courteously to them as if they were
important visitors from across the sea or somewhere
else.</p>

<p>Many executives&mdash;and this was true especially
during the war&mdash;have surrounded themselves
with a tangle of red tape which has to be unwound
every time an employee (or any one else)
wants to get near enough to ask a question. This
is absurd. Sensible men destroy elaborate plans of
management and find they get along better without
them. The Baldwin Locomotive Works,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
which has a hundred years of solid reputation behind
it, has no management plans. &ldquo;There is
about the place an atmosphere of work, and work
without frills or feathers,&rdquo; and this is essentially
true of every business that is built to last. Look
at the organizations which, because of war conditions,
rose into a prosperity they had never enjoyed
before. Most of them have collapsed, and
the little men who rose with them (so many of
them and so much too small for their jobs) have
collapsed with them.</p>

<p>In the big reliable concerns, and the small
ones, too, the high executives are easily approached,
especially by the members of the
organization. In many of the open offices&mdash;and
open offices have done much to create a feeling
of comradeship among workers&mdash;the desk of the
general manager is out on the floor with the
desks of the rank and file of the employees with
nothing to distinguish it from theirs except the
fact that there is a bigger man behind it. A real
man does not need a lot of elaborate decorations.
They annoy him.</p>

<p>There are two sides to this, however. Visitors
from the outside are not the only ones who are
likely to waste the time of other people, and a
busy man has to protect himself from indoor
nuisances as well as those that drift in from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
outside. Some do it by means of secretaries, but
a good executive needs no barrier at all between
himself and his own men. They learn soon
enough&mdash;we are speaking now of a good executive,
remember&mdash;that there is no use in going to
him unless there is some definite reason why they
should, and that the more briefly and directly
they present their problem the more likely they
are to have it settled.</p>

<p>When an executive receives a caller (or when
any man in a business house receives a caller) he
should <i>receive</i> him and not merely tolerate him.
A young advertising man who began several
years ago had two very interesting experiences
with two gruff executives in two different companies.
Both consented to see him, both kept on
writing at their desks after he entered and gave
him scant attention throughout the interview.
Apparently they were both successful business
men. Certainly they both held positions that
would indicate it. Yet both of them a few years
later came to the young advertising man at different
times looking for jobs. Needless to say
neither found a place with him, not because he
held a grudge against them, but simply because
he knew what kind of men they were and that
they could not help in the kind of business he was
trying to build.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning of the interview the host
should do all he can to make his visitor comfortable.
You see a lot in certain magazines
about setting the visitor at a disadvantage by
giving him an awkward chair, making him face
the light and grilling him with questions. It is
pure nonsense.</p>

<p>It is very gracious for a man to rise to greet a
caller and extend his hand, especially if the caller
is young and ill at ease. It is imperative if it
is an old man or a woman. He should ask the
visitor to be seated before he sits down himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young man, what can I do for you?&rdquo;
is hardly a polite way of opening an interview.
The host should wait with a cordially receptive
air until his guest begins, unless he is in a great
hurry. Then he frankly tells the caller so and
asks him to make his business brief.</p>

<p>Interruptions come even in the midst of conversations
with important visitors, but no visitor
is so important as to permit neglect of one's
employees. These should be met courteously and
dispatched quickly. The host must always ask
the pardon of the guest before turning to the
telephone or to a messenger, and if the guest is
an employee the rule is the same.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the interview the host<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
rises and shakes hands with the departing visitor
but does not necessarily go with him (or her) to
the door or the elevator, as the case may be.
This is an additional courtesy in which a busy
man cannot always indulge. The essential part
of every interview is that the visitor shall state
what he wants, that the host shall give the best
answer in his power, and then the sooner the
visitor departs the better for all concerned.</p>

<p><i>The Rank and File.</i> This is the largest group
in every business. It is the one that fluctuates
most. It is the one from which the discards are
made. It is the one from which officers are
chosen. It is the one in which the real growth of
a business takes place. And by the same token
it is the one, generally speaking, where there is
most discourtesy. Promotion depends upon the
possession of this quality much more than people
realize. Many a man with actual ability to hold
a high position is not given an opportunity to do
so because the men who employ him realize that
he would antagonize those who worked under
him.</p>

<p>There are among the body of employees in
every concern (even the very best) discontented
members. In most cases, indeed, in nearly all
cases except where there is a chronic grudge
against life which is not affected by external cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>cumstances,
these are weeded out, and those with
habitual grudges are weeded out along with the
others or else are kept in minor places. Perhaps
it would be more nearly correct to say they keep
themselves there. Sometimes a subordinate
feels that he is unfairly treated by his immediate
superior. He wishes to go to the man above
him in authority. Is it right for him to do so?</p>

<p>It is an unwritten law that each worker shall
be loyal to the head of his department. Suppose
the head does not deserve it?</p>

<p>There are three courses open to the worker.
He can leave the job and find another in a different
organization. He can go to the head of
the department and state the case to him. If
this should fail he may appeal to the man above
him, but <i>he should never go over the head of his
own immediate superior without first telling him
that he intends to do it</i>.</p>

<p>This is an important rule. It holds whether
one has a grievance to present or a suggestion.
Constructive plans should first be talked over
with one's immediate superior, and with his approval
carried to the next man, or he may carry
them himself. If this superior is the sort of man
with whom you are constantly at loggerheads,
you had much better get out and get a place
somewhere else. And if you find that continu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ally
you are in hot water with the men who have
authority over you, you may be very sure that
the fault is not altogether theirs.</p>

<p>Subordinates usually have an idea that the
heads of their departments leave all of the work
to them. Well, as a matter of fact, they do leave
a large part of it. If they did not they would
have no excuse for having subordinates. The
reward of good work is more work. This is less
of a hardship than it sounds. Sir James Barrie
once quoted Dr. Johnson's statement that doubtless
the Lord could have made a better fruit than
the strawberry, but that he doubtless never did,
and added to it that He doubtless could have
created something that was more fun than hard
work, but that He doubtless never did.</p>

<p>The subway guards in New York City say
that the rush which comes just before five o'clock
(the closing time of most of the business houses)
is as great as the one which comes just after.
They call the persons in the former rush the
clock watchers. They have left work about fifteen
minutes early, and to-morrow morning&mdash;business
experience has taught this&mdash;they will
come in fifteen minutes late. For the most part
these are the discontented workers who spend
&ldquo;60 per cent of their time in doing their job, and
40 per cent in doing the boss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has always been considered a breach of good
manners to pull out one's watch and look at it in
company. It is true in the office as well as in
the drawing room. The clock watchers are impolite.
It has also been considered a breach of
good manners to hold a guest against his will
against the conventional hour for his departure.
The employers who habitually keep their employees
after closing hours are equally impolite.
It is a question of honor, too. Time is money,
and the time grafters, whether employers or employees,
are dishonest.</p>

<p>When one employee goes over to the desk of
another it is not necessary for the second to rise.
The first should wait until the one at the desk
looks up before speaking unless he is so absorbed
in his work that he does not glance up after a
minute or two. Then he should interrupt with
&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo; It makes no difference
if one of the employees is a woman and the other
is a man. Work at an office can be seriously impeded
if every time one person goes to the desk
of another the other rises. So many times the
whole conversation covers less time than it takes
to get out of one's chair and sit back down again.
In some places subordinates are required to
stand when a superior speaks to them, but as a
general thing it is not necessary. In such houses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
it is correct to play the game according to the
general standard and to act according to the
rules set down by the men who are in charge of
affairs.</p>

<p>There is no person so wretched or so poor or
so miserable but that he can find other people
who are more wretched, poorer, or more miserable.
At the same time there is no person so
superior, so wealthy, or gifted but that he can
find other people who are more superior, more
wealthy, and more gifted. It is a part of good
manners to recognize superiority when one finds
it. Youngsters entering business can sit at the
feet of the older men in the same business and
learn a great deal. Knowledge did not enter the
world with the present generation any more
than it will depart from it when the present generation
dies. It is just as well for young people
to realize this. Age has much to teach them.
Experience has much to teach them, and so have
men and women of extraordinary ability. &ldquo;I
have never met a man,&rdquo; says a teacher of business
men, &ldquo;from whom I could not learn something.&rdquo;
All of us are born with the capacity to
learn. It is those who develop it who amount to
something.</p>

<p>Petty quarrels should be disregarded and
grudges should be forgotten. This piece of ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>vice
is needed more by women in business than
by men. Men have learned&mdash;it has taken them
several thousand years&mdash;to fight and shake
hands. They have a happy way of forgetting
their squabbles&mdash;this is a general truth&mdash;after
a little while, and two men who were yesterday
abusing one another with hot and angry words
are to-day walking together down the hall smiling
and talking as gently as you please.</p>

<p><i>The Office Boy.</i> If the office boy in a big
business house where much of the work is done
at a white-hot tension&mdash;the office boy in a busy
Wall Street office during the peak of the day's
rush, for example&mdash;could write his intimate impressions
they would make good reading.</p>

<p>The temper of the great American business
man is an uncertain quantity. Famous for good
humor and generosity as a general thing, he is,
for all that, at his worst moments the terror of
the office boy's life. Nervous, worried, tired,
and exasperated, he is likely to &ldquo;take it out&rdquo; on
the office boy if there is no one else at hand.
There is no defense for such conduct&mdash;even the
man who is guilty would not, the next day in his
calmer moments, defend it. Meantime, what
shall the office boy do?</p>

<p>A hot, tired man with papers fluttering over
his desk, his telephone ringing, and three men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
waiting in line to talk to him about serious problems
connected with the business, yells, &ldquo;What
do you want?&rdquo; when the office boy comes to
answer the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rang for me,&rdquo; the boy answers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rang half an hour ago,&rdquo; the man snaps.</p>

<p>In reality he rang two minutes before. Shall
the office boy remind him of this?</p>

<p>Not if he values his job!</p>

<p>Of course it is unjust, but one of the first laws
of discipline is to learn to be composed in the
face of injustice, and the first law of courtesy
for the office boy (and other employees would do
just as well to follow) is: Don't be too harsh with
the boss!</p>

<p>It is said that the grizzly bear, who is a very
strict mother, often spanks her cubs when she
herself has done something foolish. Julia Ellen
Rogers tells a story of an explorer who came
suddenly upon a bear with two cubs. He was so
frightened that he stood still for a minute or two
before he could decide which way to run. Meantime
the bear, fully as frightened as he, turned
and fled, spanking the two cubs at every jump
in spite of the fact that each was already going
as fast as its legs could carry it. &ldquo;It was so unexpected,&rdquo;
continues Miss Rogers, &ldquo;and so funny
to see those little bears look around reproach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>fully
at their angry parent every time they felt
the weight of her paw, helping them to hurry,
that the man sat down and laughed until he
cried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not funny to the cubs.</p>

<p>Cases in which the office boy is maltreated are
exceptional, though cases in which he is misunderstood
are not. Most office boys have not
one boss but many. There should always be one
person from whom they receive their general
orders and to whom they go with their troubles.
(A youngster should have very few troubles to
report. It is usually the worthless ones who
report.)</p>

<p>In most places the several office boys are stationed
at a certain point, a desk or a table, with
one of their number more or less in charge.
The rule is that one person be always at the
desk.</p>

<p>All right. Six office boys. Five out on errands.
One at the desk. The bell rings. The
boy keeps his place. The bell rings again. The
boy keeps his place. The bell rings a third
time, long and insistently, but the youngster,
with a steadfastness worthy of the boy who stood
on the burning deck, still keeps his place.</p>

<p>A second later an angry official bounces out
and wants to know what on earth is the matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and declares that he will report the desk to the
manager. Meanwhile one of the missing five
has returned, and the youngster who had held
the place so long under fire takes the message
from the man and delivers it.</p>

<p>If the boy should see an opening&mdash;and most
business men except those funny little executives
puffed up with their own importance are ready
enough to listen&mdash;he may explain how it happened,
but if he has to enter a shouting contest
it is best to stay silent.</p>

<p>The law of business courtesy&mdash;no matter how
far away from this a discussion goes it always
swings back&mdash;is the Golden Rule. The subordinate
who feels himself neglected by the men in
positions above him might check himself by honestly
asking himself how he appears to those
beneath him. It is interesting to know that the
one who complains most is usually the one who is
haughtiest when he enters into conversation with
the employees, who, he thinks, are not quite worth
his notice. He feels blighted because the president
does not stop to say &ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo; in
the hall, but it is beneath his dignity to say
&ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo; to the girl who collects his mail
or &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; to the janitor who comes to
dust his desk when the day's work is over. The
means of attaining courtesy&mdash;and if you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
it yourself you will find it in other people&mdash;is
by watching your own actions. Teach no
one but yourself. Worry about no one's behavior
but your own. That is job enough for
any one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h3>IN A DEPARTMENT STORE</h3>

<p>Let us now see courtesy at work in a big department
store.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins has taken a morning off to do a
little shopping before he goes away on his summer
vacation. He wants to buy two shirts, a
trunk, a toy for his baby, and a present for his
wife. He is not sure what he wants for the wife
and baby.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins does not like to shop. He remembers
his last expedition. A haberdashery
had sent him a cordial letter asking him to open
an account. He did so, but one morning later
when he went in to buy a waistcoat the rude and
inefficient service he met disgusted him so that
he has not been back since. He knew exactly
what he wanted and asked for it. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo;
answered the smart young clerk. &ldquo;You don't
want that. People have not been wearing waistcoats
like that for years. This is what you
want,&rdquo; and he exhibited a different style altogether.
It happened that Mr. Hopkins knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
better than the clerk what he wanted, and the
fact that people had not been wearing waistcoats
like it made no difference to him. As a matter
of fact, the only reason the clerk made the remark
was that he did not have them in stock, and
thought perhaps he could sell by substituting.</p>

<p>There are other haberdasheries where the service
is distinctly good, but Mr. Hopkins decides
to go to a department store instead. Haberdasheries,
however excellent, do not carry toys
for one's baby nor presents for one's wife.</p>

<p>Helpem's store has been warmly recommended.
He will go there. It is his first visit.</p>

<p>When he enters the door he is bewildered by
an array of women's scarfs and gloves and perfume
bottles, handkerchiefs and parasols, handbags,
petticoats, knick-knacks, and whatnot. He
almost loses courage and begins backing toward
the door when he catches sight of a man in uniform
standing near the entrance. He sees that
this man is directing the tides of shoppers that
are surging in, and approaches him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can I find the trunks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Third floor. Elevator in the rear,&rdquo; the man
answers briefly (but not gruffly). People who
have to answer thousands of questions must be
brief.</p>

<p>As he passes down the aisle Mr. Hopkins, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
is very observant, notices that all of the girls&mdash;most
of the clerks are girls&mdash;are dressed in a
pleasant gray. This gives an agreeable uniform
tone to a large establishment which would break
up into jarring patches of color if each clerk
were allowed to wear whatever color happened to
strike her fancy. Good idea, Mr. Hopkins
thinks, very necessary where there are many,
many clerks.</p>

<p>He does not have much trouble getting the
trunk. He knows pretty well what he wants,
and the obliging salesman convinces him that
the trunk will probably last forever by assuring
him that an elephant could dance a jig on it and
never make a dent. He asks Mr. Hopkins if he
wants his name on it. Mr. Hopkins had not
thought of it, but he does. No, upon second
thought, he will have only his initials stenciled
on in dull red, W. H. H. The trunk will be
delivered in the afternoon and he goes away well
satisfied.</p>

<p>The shirts are somewhat more difficult. He is
attached to a certain kind of collar and he likes
madras shirts with little black stripes or figures
in them. The man shows him white ones and
wide striped ones and colored ones with the right
collar, and he almost decides that the place does
not keep madras shirts with little black figures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
in them, when he suddenly realizes that he was so
intent on getting the collar that he forgot to say
anything about the material or color. He begins
again, tells the clerk exactly what he wants, and
in a few minutes the proper shirts are before him
and he is happy. While the clerk is folding them,
he asks about ties. It is a good thing. Mr.
Hopkins remembers that he has forgotten ties.
They have great bargains in ties. He drifts
over to the counter and presently has three lovely
ones. One is red, and Mr. Hopkins resolves to be
more careful than he was with the last red one.
His wife burned it. He must keep this hidden.</p>

<p>The ties remind him that he needs a bathrobe.
An agreeable clerk sells him a dull figured bathrobe,
comfortable and light for summer and
guaranteed to wash, and tells him that a pajama
sale is in progress about four counters away.</p>

<p>When he has bought six pairs of pajamas he
begins to think of the baby's present. Toys are
on the top floor. The girl there&mdash;a wise department
store always chooses carefully for this
place&mdash;is very helpful. She asks about the
baby, how old he is, what toys he has, what toys
he has asked for, and so on. Mr. Hopkins tells
her, and after showing him several ingenious mechanical
contrivances, she suggests a train with a
real track to run on. Mr. Hopkins is delighted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
The girl asks if the youngster likes to read. He
does not, but he likes to be read to. &ldquo;Why don't
you take him a book?&rdquo; and in a few minutes he
has the &ldquo;Just-So Stories&rdquo; tucked under his arm.
As he leaves the girl smiles, &ldquo;Come back to see
us,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>All the clerks have said this. The clerk
who sold the shirts said, while they stood waiting
for the change, that he could depend on them.
They would not shrink and the colors would not
run. &ldquo;We are here in the city,&rdquo; he continued
(the store was in New York), &ldquo;but we have our
regular customers just as if we were in a small
town. We don't try to make just one sale and
get by with it. We want you to come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl at the toy counter tells Mr. Hopkins
that there is a woman downstairs who will
help him select something for his wife. He goes
back to the man in uniform to locate her and
finds her in a secluded booth on the first floor.
She asks several questions about whether he
would like china or silver, furniture or linen, but
Mr. Hopkins wants to give his wife something
personal&mdash;something she can use or wear. He
has been married several years but not long
enough to know that this is a dangerous thing to
do, but the woman is wise. She suggests a silk
parasol, a kimono, or a dozen handkerchiefs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a service as this is not possible except in
very large shops, but in most places clerks are
quick to respond with suggestions for gifts.
There is a pleasure about buying them and selling
them that does not go with ordinary transactions.</p>

<p>When he buys a parasol the clerk suggests
that they have a very large assortment of handbags,
but Mr. Hopkins's day's work is done, and
the clerk does not insist. None of the clerks in
a good department store is insistent. They offer
suggestions and stand ready to serve, but they
do not try to impose their ideas or their goods
upon the customers. Mr. Hopkins leaves well
satisfied with himself and his purchases. He
will come back.</p>

<p>The trunk is delivered in the afternoon, not by
the regular wagon, but by an express company.
It is a busy season. Mr. Hopkins is still further
delighted. These people keep their promises.
And as he tips the man who brought it up&mdash;he
had to climb three flights of stairs&mdash;the man
gives him a card. &ldquo;Here's one of the boss's
cards,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in case you want any hauling
done.&rdquo; Without doubt the man has been instructed
by the boss to distribute his cards, but he
does it with such a grace that it seems to be on his
own initiative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>It rarely happens that a business man or woman
can shop in the leisurely manner described
above. Most of their shopping has to be done
during the half hour after lunch or during a
frantic few minutes snatched at the beginning or
the end of the day's work. One morning Mr.
Hopkins had to leave home without a collar because
he forgot to send the dirty ones to the laundry
(his wife was away that week) and dashed
into a little shop to get one on the way to the
office. He would have felt like murdering a
clerk who wanted to show him something nice in
the way of gloves or mufflers, and he would have
had a hard time to restrain himself from violence
if the clerk had started in on a eulogy of a new
shipment of English tweeds.</p>

<p>An intelligent clerk can usually tell when his
customer is in a tearing hurry. It is an unpropitious
time to make suggestions. The clerk
must see things from the customer's point of
view. It is permissible to suggest something
else in place of the thing he has asked for but it
is not good manners to make fun of it or to insist
upon a substitute. Recently a woman wanted
to buy a rug for her automobile. She knew just
what she wanted, but the bright young clerk insisted
that she wanted something else. She finally
bought the rug, but it was in spite of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
clerk rather than because of him. Too many
salesmen kill their sales by thinking and talking
only of their product. The customer is not half
so interested in that as he is in himself. Good
salesmanship relates the product to the customer,
and does it in such a way that the customer is
hardly aware of how it is done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<h3>A WHILE WITH A TRAVELING MAN</h3>

<p><i>In a Big City.</i> We will suppose that our traveling
man has his headquarters in some big city&mdash;New
York, Chicago, San Francisco, it does not
matter&mdash;and that he has several calls to make before
he goes out on the road.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of salesmen, those who
make only one sale to a customer and those who
sell something that has to be renewed periodically.
The first sell pianos, real estate, encyclopedias,
and so on; the second sell raw materials
and supplies. The salesman whom we are to
follow is in the second group.</p>

<p>He has&mdash;and so have most men who do this
kind of selling&mdash;a regular routine that he follows,
adding new names to the list and deleting
old ones as seems expedient. At this particular
time he has several old customers to visit
and one or two new prospects to investigate before
he leaves town.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for him to make arrange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>ments
beforehand to gain access to the old customers.
They know him and they are always
glad to see him. But if there is a chance that the
customer may be out of town, or if it is during a
busy season, he telephones ahead to make sure.
He prefers indefinite to definite appointments,
especially if he has to see two or three people during
the course of a morning or an afternoon; that
is, he would rather have an appointment to come
some time between ten and eleven or between
three and four than to have one for exactly half
past ten or a quarter of three. It is impossible
to tell how long interviews will last. Sometimes
when the salesman counts on staying an hour he
is through in five minutes and sometimes when
he thinks he can arrange things in fifteen minutes
he finds himself strung up for half a day.</p>

<p>The new prospects&mdash;there are three on this
particular morning&mdash;he handles in different
ways. To one he has a note of introduction from
a mutual friend. To another he has written a
letter stating why he wishes to call and asking
when it will be convenient for him to do so. The
third, whom he knows by reputation as a &ldquo;hard
customer&rdquo; (in the slang sense of the word) who
will have nothing to do with salesmen of any sort,
he decides to approach directly, trusting to his
own presence to get past the girl at the front door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and whomsoever else stands between him and the
man he wants to see. He does not write, because
he knows that the man would tear up the letter
and he does not telephone, because he knows that
the man would not promise to see him and that if
he were to call after such a telephone conversation
his chances for success would be lessened.</p>

<p>Our salesman is careful with his appearance.
He bathes and shaves every morning and takes
special care that his linen is clean and that his
shoes are polished. He does not ornament himself
with a lot of jewelry, and the material of
which his suit is made is plain. He presents, if
you should see him on the street, the appearance
of a clean, solid, healthy, progressive American
citizen. He is poised but he is not aggressive.
He is persistent but he is not obstinate.</p>

<p>The best public speakers, it is said, never get
over a sinking feeling of fear during the few minutes
just before time for them to speak. It vanishes
as soon as they get to their feet or a very
few minutes afterward, and, strange as it may
seem, it is this very fear that gives them their
power on the platform. The fact that they have
the dreadful feeling nerves them to strenuous
effort, and it is this effort that makes the orator.
In the same way the best salesmen are
those who never get over the fear that perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
they have not thought out the best way to handle
the situation ahead of them. They forget the
fear as they begin to talk to the prospect, but the
fact that it is subconsciously present makes
the difference between the real salesman and
the &ldquo;dub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did you ever get to the door of a house you
were about to enter and then turn and walk
around the block before you rang the bell? Did
you ever walk around the block six or eight
times? So have we. Especially on those Wednesday
and Sunday evenings when we used to
go calling. There are not many salesmen who
have not had this experience and who have not,
upon hearing that a prospect they dreaded was
out, turned away from the door with a prayer of
deep thanksgiving. All of which is by way of
saying that selling is not an easy job.</p>

<p>The salesman whose career we are following
for a short time always has that little feeling of
nervousness before an interview. It is deeper
than ever when he approaches the &ldquo;hard customer,&rdquo;
and it is not lessened in the least degree
when he finds a painted and marceled flapper at
the door who looks at him without a word. (Incidentally,
she likes his looks.)</p>

<p>He takes out his card and asks her to give it to
Mr. Green and say that he is calling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He won't see you,&rdquo; the girl says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell him, please, that I am here, all
the same? Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He takes the card and scribbles on it, &ldquo;I want
only five minutes of your time,&rdquo; and hands it to
the girl again.</p>

<p>She carries it away and presently returns saying
that Mr. Green is busy and cannot see
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew he wouldn't,&rdquo; she adds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be very busy,&rdquo; the salesman says.
&ldquo;When shall I be most likely to find him free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's no busier now than usual,&rdquo; the girl responds.
&ldquo;He's smoking a cigar and looking out
the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell him, please, that I am coming
back to-morrow at the same time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl sees that he is very much in earnest.
She respects him for his quiet persistence and
because he has not tried to &ldquo;kid&rdquo; her. She would
most likely have joined in heartily if he had, but
he would never have got past her.</p>

<p>She goes back into the office and returns with
word that the salesman may come in if he will
not take more than five minutes. He thanks the
girl and goes into the office where the &ldquo;hard customer&rdquo;
is seated. He does not rise, he does not
say &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; and he does not take the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
cigar out of his mouth, but this does not disconcert
the salesman. He wastes no time in preliminaries,
but after a brief greeting, plunges at
once into his proposition, stating the essential
points clearly and in terms of this man's business.
He knows what the customer needs pretty
accurately for he has taken the trouble to find
out. He is not broadcasting. He is using line
radio, and everything he says is directed against
a single mark. The prospect is interested. He
puts the cigar aside. The salesman concludes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but my five minutes are
up. Will you let me come back some day when
you are not so busy and tell you more about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit where you are,&rdquo; the other says, and begins
firing questions.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the salesman pockets the
order he wanted and makes ready to depart, feeling
that he has found another friend. The &ldquo;hard
customer&rdquo; is ashamed of his gruff reception and
apologizes for it. &ldquo;I've been so bothered with
agents and drummers and traveling men that
I've promised myself never to see another one as
long as I live,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well understand that,&rdquo; the salesman answers.
&ldquo;It is one of the hardest things we are
up against, the fact that there are so many four-flushers
out trying to sell things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He goes next to see the man with whom he has
made an appointment by mail and finds that he
has been called out of town on business. He
talks with his secretary, who expresses a polite regret
that they were unable to locate him in time
to tell him that his visit would be of no use. He
asks if there is some one else who can take charge
of the matter, but the girl replies that all such
things have to come before Mr. Thompson. He
will not be back until next week, and by that time
the salesman will be out on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have another representative of our house,
Mr. Hamilton, call,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He will write
to find out when it will be convenient for him to
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third man on his list is the one to whom
he has the letter of introduction. This is one of
his best prospects. That is why he took such
pains to arm himself with the letter. He has no
trouble getting inside. The man is very busy
but he thrusts it completely aside for the moment.
He does not have to say &ldquo;Be brief.&rdquo; Our salesman
has been in the game long enough to know
that he must not be anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; he says at the end of the talk, &ldquo;I
am not interested. I have no doubt that what
you say is true. In fact, I have heard of your
firm before and know that its reputation is good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
But I buy my material, and have for years, from
Hicks and Hicks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good reliable concern,&rdquo; the salesman
responds, &ldquo;and there is no reason why you should
desert them. They depend upon you as much
as you do upon them. But if they happen to be
short of something you want in a hurry, please
remember that our product is as good as theirs.
You can depend upon it with as much certainty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will,&rdquo; the prospect answers
and the interview is over.</p>

<p>Did the salesman act wisely? Would he have
gained anything by proving that his house was
superior to Hicks and Hicks? Not if the customer
was worth having. This salesman never
forgets that his part of the job is to build up
business for his own firm, and not to tear down
business for other firms. As it stands, he has in
this case established a feeling of good will for
the house he represents, and has placed it in
such a light that if the rival concern should be
afflicted with a strike or a fire or any of a hundred
or two disasters which might lessen or suspend
its output, the customer will probably turn
to the salesman's house. And if Hicks and
Hicks should sell out or go into bankruptcy the
salesman will have won for his own house a
steady customer of great value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p><i>In the Sleeping Car.</i> The wise traveling man&mdash;and
our salesman is wise&mdash;always engages
sleeping accommodations on the train in advance.
This time he has the lower berth in
No. 9.</p>

<p>When he comes in to take his seat he finds that
a woman has the upper berth in the same compartment.
He is reading a newspaper and she
is reading a magazine. He says nothing until
toward evening, and then he offers to exchange
places with her. She thanks him cordially, explains
that she was late in securing a berth and
that this was all she could get. She is very
grateful and the transfer is made.</p>

<p>He goes into the smoking car and meets there
several men who are talking together. He joins
them and the conversation runs along pleasantly
enough until one of the number begins to retail
dirty stories. Some of the others try to switch
him off to another subject but he is wound up
and nothing short of a sledge hammer will stop
him until he has run down. Our salesman has
a healthy loathing for this sort of thing. He
has a good fund of stories himself&mdash;most traveling
men have&mdash;and in the course of his journeyings
he has heard many of the kind that the
foul-minded man in the smoking car is retailing
with such delight. He never retells stories of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
that nature, and he never, when he can avoid it,
listens to them. He knows that he cannot stop
the man, but after a little while he gets up quietly
and leaves. Another man follows him and the
two stand on the rear platform of the train until
time to go to bed.</p>

<p>Men who are traveling together often converse
without knowing one another's names, and
it is correct that they should. Only a prig refuses
to speak to a man on a train or a boat because
he does not know his name. Opening
conversation with a stranger is not always easy,
and should be avoided unless it comes about in
a natural way. The stranger may not want to
converse. It is correct for a man who wishes
to talk to another first to introduce himself.
&ldquo;My name is Hammond,&rdquo; he says, and the man
to whom he says it responds by holding out his
hand (this is the more gracious way, but he may
omit this part of it, if he likes) and pronouncing
his own name. The same rule holds when the
travelers are women.</p>

<p>Our salesman goes to bed early.</p>

<p>Two men have the compartment across from
his. They seem very much interested in each
other, for they continue to talk after they have
gone to bed. In order to make themselves heard
they have almost to scream, and the raucous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
sound of their voices is much more disturbing
than the sound of the wheels grinding against
the rails. It is hard to sleep on a train even
under favorable circumstances. Our salesman
has a strenuous day ahead of him&mdash;most of his
days are strenuous&mdash;and the noise is keeping
him awake.</p>

<p>He could throw on his bathrobe, climb down
and remonstrate with the two men across the
way. It would be correct for him to do so, but
it would hardly be expedient. People who are
thoughtless enough to be noisy late at night are
often rude enough to be very unpleasant when
any one interferes. The salesman has no
real authority over them, but the porter on duty
at night is supposed to see that a certain amount
of peace and quiet is maintained. The salesman
rings the bell, and when the porter appears,
asks him if he would mind begging the two men
across the aisle to lower their voices. The porter
has had years of experience. He has developed
a soft, pleasant way of asking people to be quiet,
and in a few minutes the car is still except for
the inevitable sound of the train and the snoring
of an old lady near the end of the car. This
last cannot be helped. It must be endured, and
our salesman composes himself into a deep
slumber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Dressing and undressing in a sleeping car are
among the most difficult operations to perform
gracefully. There are no rules. Most men prefer
staying in their berths to making the attempt
in the crowded dressing rooms. Some divide
the process between the two, but no gentleman
ever goes streaking down the aisle half-dressed.
He is either fully clothed or else he is wrapped in
a bathrobe or a dressing gown.</p>

<p>When our salesman comes in to breakfast the
next morning there is only one vacant place, a
seat opposite a young woman at a table for
two. He crosses over and sits down, first asking
if he may do so. In well-managed dining
cars and restaurants, the seating is taken care
of by the head waiter. He never places a person
at a table with some one else without asking
permission of the one who is already seated. It
is never permissible for a stranger to go to a
table that is already taken if there is a vacant
one available. The young lady bows and smiles.
She has already sent in her order. They talk
during the meal quite as if they had been introduced
and had met by appointment instead of
by accident. She does not introduce herself, nor
does he introduce himself. When she has finished
she asks the waiter for her bill. She pays
it herself&mdash;our salesman has too much delicacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
to offer to do so&mdash;and tips the waiter. Then
with a nod and a smile she is gone.</p>

<p>This salesman is a chivalrous traveler. Whenever
there is an opportunity to render a service to
a woman (or to any one else) he takes pleasure in
doing it. He does not place women under
financial obligation to him, however, and he is
careful not to annoy them with attentions. He
has many times found a taxi for a woman traveling
alone or with children when they have had
the same destination; he has helped women
decipher time tables; he has carried bundles
and suitcases and baskets and boxes for old
ladies who have not yet learned in all their long,
long lives that the way to travel is with as little,
instead of with as much, baggage as possible; and
he has helped young mothers establish themselves
comfortably in place with their children. But
he has never&mdash;and he has been traveling a good
many years now&mdash;thrust himself upon a woman
and he has never embarrassed one by his attentions.</p>

<p>He does not &ldquo;treat&rdquo; the men whom he meets
by accident during his travels. They often go
in to meals together but each one settles his own
bill, and when they come to the end of the
journey they are without obligations toward one
another. It is much pleasanter so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>The salesman does not, as a rule, tip the porter
until he leaves the train, and the amount that
he gives then is according to what the porter has
done for him. If he has been in the car a good
many hours and if he has had to ask the porter
for many things, such as bringing ice water at
night, silencing objectionable travelers, bringing
pillows and tables during the day, not to
mention polishing his shoes and brushing his
coat every morning, he is much more generous
than if he had been on the car only a few hours
and had not asked for any special service. Unless
the trip is long he never gives more than a
dollar. Twenty-five cents is the minimum.</p>

<p><i>By Automobile</i>. From an economic point of
view this problem has come to be almost as large
as the railroad problem, and the part the automobile,
including trucks and taxis, plays in
business is growing larger and larger every year.</p>

<p>Motorists have a code of their own. They&mdash;when
they do as they should&mdash;drive to the right
in the United States, to the left in certain other
countries. They take up no more of the road
than is necessary, and they observe local traffic
regulations scrupulously, not only because they
will be fined if they do not but because it is impolite
in Rome to do other than the Romans do.
They hold out their hands to indicate that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
are about to turn, they slow down at crossings,
and they sound their horns as a warning signal
but never for any other reason.</p>

<p>It is often necessary for a man who is trying to
sell a piece of property to take out to look at it
the man who thinks he will buy it. Needless to
say, it is the former who pays for the trip. Other
business trips are arranged by groups, the benefit
or pleasure which is to result to be shared
among them. Under such conditions it is wise
(and polite) for them to divide expenses. These
matters should be arranged ahead of time. If
one is to furnish the machine, and one the gasoline,
and another is to pay for the lunch, it
should be understood at the outset.</p>

<p><i>In a Small Town.</i> The salesman is now completely
out of the metropolitan district. He is
in a small town like hundreds of others over the
United States. The hotel is very good in itself,
but compared with the one in the city, which he
has just left, it is inconvenient. He has better
judgment than to remind the people of this.
Instead, when he is talking to them&mdash;and he
likes to talk with the people in the towns he is
serving&mdash;he talks about what they have rather
than what they have not and about what they
can do in the future rather than what they have
failed to do in the past. It is in this way that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
he discovers how he can best be useful to them.</p>

<p>He likes to work at the quick pace set by the
big cities but he knows it will not do here. He
goes around to see Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter is
glad to see him, but he has had a bad year. The
crops have not been good, the banks have not
been generous, his wife has been sick, and one of
his children has broken a leg. The salesman
listens sympathetically to this tale of woe, leads
the conversation away from the bad year behind
to the good year ahead, and in a little while they
are eagerly discussing plans for business in the
next month or so. The salesman shows how he
can help, and convinces Mr. Carter that the best
time to begin is right now and gets an order for
supplies from him. It has taken the better part
of the morning, and Mr. Carter asks him to go
home with him to lunch. The salesman would
prefer going back to the hotel, but he knows that
it will give Mr. Carter great pleasure to have
him&mdash;his invitation is unmistakably hearty&mdash;so
he accepts.</p>

<p>Before he came the salesman had discovered,
through consulting the directories and by talking
with friends of his who knew the town, who
were worth going to see and who were not. Mr.
Carter he had learned was immensely worth while
and that is why he was willing to spend so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
time with him. No salesman can afford to stop
and talk with everybody who can give him the
inside story of why business is no good. This
salesman always finds out as much as possible
about a man before he goes to see him. He never
leaps blindly ahead when there is any way to
get a gleam of light first.</p>

<p>Once in South Carolina he was anxious to
get a large order from a wealthy old man who,
he felt sure, would be a regular customer if he
could once be persuaded to buy. The old man
paid no attention to what he was saying until
he mentioned the picture of a hunting dog that
hung above the desk. The old man's eyes kindled.
This was his hobby and he forgot all about
business while he talked about hunting, and
ended by asking the salesman to go home with
him and spend the night. The salesman accepted
gladly, and the next morning they went
rabbit hunting instead of going back to the
office. The salesman was out of practice in
handling a gun but it was great fun, and the upshot
of it all was that he &ldquo;landed&rdquo; the order he
wanted.</p>

<p>This method is pleasant but wasteful. The
salesman never uses it except as a last resource.</p>

<p>Much of the success of this salesman (and of
the others who are successful) lies in the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
that he can put himself so completely into the
place of the man he is trying to sell. He talks
in terms of that man's work, and he tries to sell
only where he believes the sale will result in
mutual satisfaction. He never says anything
about serving humanity, but his life is shaped
around this idea, which is, when all is said and
done, the biggest idea that any of us can lay
ourselves out to follow.</p>

<p>He is working for a firm that he knows is
honest&mdash;no self-respecting man will work for
any other kind&mdash;and he wants its financial rating
to stand solid. He does not sell to every man
who wants to buy. He investigates his credit
first, and if there is to be a delay while the investigation
is under way he frankly tells the man
so, and assures him that it is for his protection
as well as for that of the house that is selling the
goods. &ldquo;It is a form we go through with every
new customer,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If we did not we'd
find ourselves swamped with men who would not
pay. And that would work hardship on those
who do.&rdquo; Every business man knows that this
is the only way in which reliable business can be
carried on. And it is reliable business that we
are interested in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<h3>TABLES FOR TWO OR MORE</h3>

<p>A young banker from Smithville is in New
York. It is his first trip.</p>

<p>You would like him if you could see him. Tall,
sun-burned, clean-cut, well-dressed, thoroughly
alive and interested in everything. He is a bit
confused by the city but he is determined to learn
everything that it has to teach him. He does
not hesitate to ask questions but he likes to find
out without, whenever possible.</p>

<p>He goes into the dining room of the great
hotel where he is staying, and for the first time
in his life is confronted with an array of silver on
both sides of his plate. At home he always has
a knife, fork, and spoon laid together at the
right of his plate, by which you can see that he
has not lived among people who place much
emphasis on having food daintily or correctly
served. He is not exactly prepared for this.
When he left Smithville he was thinking more
of his business connections than of what he was
going to eat, and how. He is embarrassed be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>cause,
like every sanely balanced person, he likes
to do things as they should be done, and not just
blunder through them. There is no one he can
ask except the waiter, and the waiter seems such
a superior person that he is afraid to ask
him (though it would have been perfectly correct
for him to do so). He gets through the
meal the best way he can and finds that when the
ice cream is brought the only thing he has left
to eat it with is a slender fork with a long handle
and three very tiny prongs. He knows that
he has tripped up somewhere along the line,
but he asks the waiter to bring him a spoon
(he should have asked for a fork) and goes
ahead.</p>

<p>The next day he is invited out to dinner with
a man who has all of his life been accustomed
to first-class hotels and restaurants and the dining
tables of wealthy and cultured people. He
is somewhat older than our young banker and
he has had a great deal of experience in entertaining
men who have come into the city from
small towns. He is thoughtful, sympathetic,
an excellent host. He leads the way into the
dining room (though they stand together in such
a way that it seems that neither is leading) and
chooses a table. This nearly always means accepting
the one the head waiter indicates,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
though it is quite correct for the host to suggest
the table he would like to have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does this suit you?&rdquo; he asks the young banker
before they sit down.</p>

<p>It suits him exactly. He says as much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what will you have to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter has given him a menu card, containing,
so it seems to the young man, a million
things that he might have. A dinner served
in courses was something beyond his knowledge
until the night before, and the dinner then was
<i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> instead of <i>&agrave; la carte</i>. He flounders
through the card and is about ready to thrust it
aside and say, &ldquo;Just bring me some ham and
eggs&rdquo; when his host sees his predicament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blue Points are usually good at this time of
the year,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Shall we try them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man has not the remotest idea what
Blue Points are but he thinks it will be very delightful
to try them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of soup do you like?&rdquo; the host
continues when the waiter has departed. &ldquo;I see
they have vegetable soup and consomm&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man clutches at the familiar straw.
He will have vegetable soup.</p>

<p>Throughout the meal the host makes comments
and suggestions and guides his guest through to
the end, and does it so graciously that the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
man from Smithville is not aware that he is doing
it, and feels that it is all due to his own quick
observation that he is getting along so well. No
business man is a perfect host until he can accomplish
this.</p>

<p>Our young man knows already that one should
sit up at a table and not lean forward or lounge
back, that he should not take large mouthfuls
and that he should not snap at his food, that he
should eat without noise and with great cleanliness.
He knows that his napkin should be unfolded
(it should be unfolded once and not
spread out) and laid across his lap, not tucked
into his collar or the top of his vest. He knows
that he should not eat with his knife.</p>

<p>He has never seen a finger bowl before but
he has heard of them, so that when one is placed
before him he knows that he should dip the ends
of his fingers into it and dry them on his napkin.
He has also heard that toothpicks are never
used by gentlemen, at least in public, and he is
not surprised when he does not see them.</p>

<p>He has read somewhere that when a knife or
a fork is dropped to the floor he should not pick
it up himself but should allow the waiter to do
so, and that the waiter should be allowed to clear
away the damage when something is upset on
the table. He knows that long apologies are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
out of order anywhere, and he is not likely to
say anything more than &ldquo;Excuse me&rdquo; or &ldquo;I beg
your pardon&rdquo; if he should by a clumsy movement
break a glass or overturn a plate of soup.</p>

<p>But he does not know about the various knives
and forks or about how courses are arranged, and
he does not know about tips.</p>

<p>It is correct for him to explain to his host, just
as Pip did when he was dining for the first time
with Herbert Pocket, that he is unused to such
things and beg him to give him a few hints as
they go along. But it is less embarrassing to
consult a book of etiquette about fundamentals
and to pick up the other knowledge by close observation.</p>

<p>He discovers&mdash;our young friend uses both
methods&mdash;that knives are laid at the right of the
plate in the order in which they are to be used, beginning
at the outside, and that the spoons are
laid just beyond the knives in the same order. The
butter knife (which rarely appears at dinner
time) is usually laid across the little bread plate
at the left of the dinner plate. Forks are placed
at the left of the plate in the order in which they
are to be used, except the oyster fork, which is
laid across the knives or else is brought in with
the oysters. The steel knife is for cutting meats.
The flat fork with the short prongs is for salads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Salads are always eaten with a fork. It is sometimes
not very easy to do, but it is the only correct
way.</p>

<p>This is the general standard, but there are deviations
from it. Nothing but experience in
dining&mdash;and a great deal of it&mdash;will teach one
to know always what fork or what knife or what
spoon to use when the table service is highly
elaborate. The best policy for a stranger under
such conditions is that of watchful and unobtrusive
waiting.</p>

<p>The dinners that business men choose for
themselves are rarely divided into numerous
courses. Often they have only two: meat and
vegetables, and dessert. The regular order for
a six-course dinner is: first, an appetizer such as
oyster cocktail, grapefruit, strawberries, or something
of the sort, followed by soup, fish, meat and
vegetables, salad, dessert, cheese and crackers.
One or more of the courses is often omitted.</p>

<p>The rule for tipping is universally the same:
Ten per cent of the bill.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Suppose the cases had been reversed and the
man from the city had been in Smithville to take
dinner with the young banker.</p>

<p>He is not accustomed to seeing all of the food
put on the table at one time, nor to having to use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the same fork throughout the meal. But he is
a gentleman. He adapts himself to their standard
so readily that not one of the people at the
table could tell but that he had always lived that
way.</p>

<p>The young banker is a gentleman, too. When
his friends from the city come to visit him he
gives them the best he has and does not apologize
for it. He does not begin by saying, &ldquo;I know
you are used to having better things than this
but I suppose you can stand it for one meal.&rdquo;
He simply ushers his guest into the dining room
as cordially and with as little affectation as if he
were the paying teller of the Smithville bank.
No one need ever apologize when he has done or
given his best.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that the standard of
our young banker is growing higher and higher
all the time. He likes to know how the people
who have had time to make an art of dining do it
and to adapt his ways to theirs whenever he can.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>It is a grave mistake for a business man to
feel that he must entertain another to the standard
to which the second is accustomed. A poor
man who finds himself under the necessity of
entertaining a rich one should not feel that he
must do it on a grand scale if he has been so en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>tertained
by a rich one. Aside from the moral
question involved the great game of bluff is too
silly and vulgar a one for grown men to play.</p>

<p>But business men play it and their wives join
in. Suppose Mrs. Davis, whose husband is an
assistant of Mr. Burke, wishes to invite Mrs.
Burke to her home to dinner. She and Mr.
Davis have been formally entertained in the
other home, and the dinner they had there
was superintended by a butler and carefully
manipulated by two maids. Now Mrs. Davis
has no maid, her china is very simple, and the
food that she and her husband have, even when
they entertain their friends, is plain and wholesome.
Should she, for the great occasion, hire
more beautiful china and engage servants?
Should she draw on the savings bank for more
delicate viands?</p>

<p>To begin with, Mr. Burke knows exactly what
salary Mr. Davis gets. He knows whether it
will warrant such expenditure. Will it make
him feel like placing more responsibility on his
assistant's shoulders to see him living beyond
his means? Is it not, after all, much better for
people to meet face to face instead of hiding
themselves behind masks? The masks are not
pretty, and in most cases deceive only the persons
who wear them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Men who are friends in business often like
their wives to be friends as well. It is many
times possible to bring about a meeting at the
home of a common friend, but when this is not
convenient, one of the women may invite the
other. If the invitation is to dinner, it is not
correct for Mr. Gardner to invite Mrs. Shandon
even if he knows her and his wife does not. The
invitation should go from Mrs. Gardner and
should be addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Shandon.
If the invitation is for tea, Mrs. Gardner simply
invites Mrs. Shandon, and the nature of the invitation
depends upon whether the affair is
formal or informal.</p>

<p>As to which of two women should proffer the
first invitation there might be some discussion.
Usually it is the wife of the man whose position is
superior, if they both work for the same concern.
It frequently happens that a man whose
position in business is high is married to a
woman whose social standing is not of corresponding
importance. Perhaps such a man has
a subordinate whose wife is a social leader. In
this case which of the women should extend the
first invitation?</p>

<p>Most women of eminent social rank realize
and appreciate the fact thoroughly. The social
leader knows that the other woman might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
embarrassed and hesitant about inviting her to
her home. If she does apprehend this it is only
gracious for her to extend the first invitation
herself.</p>

<p>In small towns the rule is for the old residents
to call upon the new, and the wife of a business
man who has recently established himself in a
community must wait until the women who live
there have called upon her before she begins to
entertain them.</p>

<p>In large cities where it is impossible to know
everyone this rule is practically disregarded, and
business men invite one another and ask their
wives to do the same according to the way convenience
and chance make most natural. Women
whose husbands are longest in the employ of
a firm, or whose husbands hold high positions, as
a rule call first on the wives of newcomers or
subordinates.</p>

<p>It all comes to the same thing whether it is in
a city or a small town or the country. Those
who are already established in the neighborhood
or the business extend the right hand of welcome
and good fellowship to those who are not.</p>

<p>In order to bring their employees together
socially most big houses now give various entertainments
such as picnics, parties, dances, and
banquets. They are in no way different from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
other entertainments of the same kind so far as
the etiquette of behavior is concerned. Formal
dances and banquets in the evening require evening
dress just the same, except with that very
enormous group (to which most of us belong)
who do not own evening dress. This does not
mean that evening parties must be foregone by
this group or that they should hire gala attire
for the occasion, but simply that the men wear
their business suits and the girls their &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo;
dresses. It is just as correct, it is just as much
fun, and it is infinitely wiser than giving a
dollar down and a dollar a week for a <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>
gown or a swallow-tail outfit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h3>LADIES FIRST?</h3>

<p>Most girls who are in business are there to
earn a living.</p>

<p>It is true that an increasing number of wealthy
girls who are under no necessity to work but who
want a definite place in the economic life of the
world are entering business every year, but the
great army of workers is made up of those who
enter business because they are driven into it
(driven, many of them, while they are yet very
young), because it is the only way in which they
can have their own money, or because it is the
only way in which they can raise their standard
of living.</p>

<p>The majority of business girls come from the
homes of parents in moderate circumstances.
They have had advantages&mdash;a high-school or a
college diploma, a certificate from a business
school, travel, specialized training&mdash;and all these
they have added to their business capital. In
many instances the opportunities they have had
have not been brilliant, but every opportunity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
however small, carries with it the responsibility
to make the best of it. Upon these girls, since
they outnumber the others and because they have
had advantages (a high-school education is an
enormous advantage if you are looking at it from
the point of view of a person who wanted one but
was not able to get it), rests the responsibility of
setting the pace for others. And the standard
of behavior for the business girl, whether she be
rich or poor or in between, is the same.</p>

<p>The wealthy girls who enter business deliberately
are usually followed by the same sensible
impulse that started them on their careers, and,
as a rule, they conduct themselves with dignity
and modesty. The wealthy girls who, through a
turn of fortune have been forced into work and
have gone unwillingly, are another matter. &ldquo;The
rudest girls we have,&rdquo; is the testimony of most
people who have to deal with them. Conventional
social charm and poise they may have but
they are without that finer sense of courtesy
which makes them accept whatever fate gives
them and make the best of it. The fading
splendor of the days of plenty envelops them
like a cloud&mdash;remember that we are speaking of
the unwilling ones&mdash;they lose themselves in self-pity,
and the great fun that comes from good
work they miss entirely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the poor girls in business have never
known anything but poverty, and their lives have
been cast among people who have never known
anything else. They have had no home training
in the art of behavior (for the people at home
did not know how to give it to them). No one
has ever told them how to dress or act but there
have never been lacking those to condemn them
when they dressed foolishly or acted indiscreetly.
&ldquo;The silly little things,&rdquo; they say (and oh, how
superior they are when they say it). Employers
agree, for, after all, it is true, and the silly little
things hold their jobs until they are married,
until they are fired, or (and this happens frequently)
until they wake up, and then they are
promoted to something better. We cannot expect
girls like these, who have grown up without
contact with the gentler side of life, to begin with
a high standard of behavior, but we can (and
do) expect them, once they have been brought
into touch with better things, to raise their standard.
It is no disgrace for a girl to begin in
ignorance and squalor; the disgrace lies in staying
there.</p>

<p>First of all, the dress of the business girl.
Most of the ill-breeding in the world is due to
ignorance. Ignorance of the laws of beauty
and taste causes one to make a display of finery,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and over-dressing is a mark of vulgarity whether
one can afford it or not.</p>

<p>The girl does not live&mdash;we believe this is right&mdash;who
does not love pretty clothes. But the
average girl does not have money to spend lavishly
for them. Her salary, as a rule, is not
princely, and there are often financial as well as
moral obligations to the people at home. She
cannot have Sunday clothes and everyday
clothes. She must combine the two with the
emphasis on the latter.</p>

<p>A few years ago it was almost impossible to
accomplish this, but manufacturers have recognized
her needs and are now making clothes especially
for her&mdash;plain dresses in bright colors
and dark dresses with a happy bit of trimming
here and there, neat enough to pass the censorship
of the strictest employer, pretty enough to
please the most exacting young girl.</p>

<p>A woman is no longer thought eccentric if
she wears low heels. The modern flapper is too
sensible for such nonsense as French heels for
standing all day behind the counter. Manufacturers
have discovered this also, and are making
shoes with low heels and broad toes quite as
pleasing as the French monstrosities and infinitely
more comfortable.</p>

<p>A business girl&mdash;or any girl, for that matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>&mdash;should
take pains with her hands and her hair.
Coiffures that might be appropriate in a ball room
are out of place in an office, and heavily
jeweled hands, whether the jewels are real or
imitation, are grotesquely unsuited to office work.
(So are dirty ones.)</p>

<p>Hair that is glossy and tidy, hands that are
clean and capable, dress that is trim and inconspicuous&mdash;add
to these intelligence, willingness,
good health, and good manners and there is not
much left to be desired.</p>

<p>Certain positions expose girls to the temptation
of dress more than others. She, for instance,
who all day handles lovely garments or
she who all day poses before long mirrors in exquisite
gowns that other women are to wear&mdash;can
one expect these girls to go merrily home at
night to a hall bedroom with a one-burner gas
jet and a mournful array of old furniture? They
have a problem that the girl in a glue factory
or a fish cannery does not have to meet&mdash;at least
not in so concrete a form. At the same time they
have an opportunity that these other girls do
not have, and it rests with them whether the
opportunity or the temptation gets the upper
hand.</p>

<p>Positions in which girls are thrown into close
contact with men expose them to temptation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
another sort. It is in its most acute form when
it brings a poor girl into more or less intimate
association with a rich man. Once, a very long
time ago, a king married a beggar maid and
they lived happily ever after. People have not
stopped writing and talking about it yet,
although it is many centuries since it happened.
It is true that once in a very great while
a girl marries her father's chauffeur or her brother's
valet and finds later that she has acted
wisely; but these are rare exceptions to the general
rule, for the result usually is unhappiness.
Such marriages are always the occasion for big
headlines in the paper, usually a double set of
them, for, in most instances, the divorce follows
within a year or so.</p>

<p>It is a dangerous thing for a girl to receive
attentions indiscriminately from men, especially
those who drift across her horizon from the great
world outside. It is dangerous (is it necessary
to add that it is incorrect?) for a manicurist to
accept presents from the millionaire whose hands
she looks after. It is unwise for any girl to
accept expensive gifts from a man who is not her
fianc&eacute;.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to this rule, as indeed to
every other. At Christmas or at the time a ceremony
or an anniversary employers sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
give their secretaries or another trusted employee
a beautiful gift, and it is within the bounds of
propriety for the employee to accept it. Often
when he has been away from the office for several
weeks a man presents his secretary a gift
to express his gratitude for the capable way in
which she has managed affairs in his absence,
and this gift the secretary is privileged to accept.
Gifts are seldom presented except where
the association has been a long and highly satisfactory
one.</p>

<p>But the girl who goes to the theatre with a
man about whom she knows nothing except that
he has the price of the tickets is running a serious
risk. She is violating one of the most rigid principles
of etiquette and she is skating perilously
out beyond the line marked off by common sense.
Nearly every man can, and does, if he is the
right sort, present credentials before asking
a girl if he may call or if he may escort her
to a place of amusement. There are instances
in romantic stories and in real life where a
man and a maid have met without the help of
a third party and have entered upon a charming
friendship. They are rare, rarer in fact
than in fiction. It is banal to say that a girl
can usually tell. But she can, and if she has
any doubt (and this is true of all her relations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
with men) she should have no doubt. She should
stop where she is.</p>

<p>Where men and girls work together in the
same building or in buildings near one another
they often go to the same restaurant for lunch.
It is natural that they should sometimes sit together
at the same tables. It is correct for a
man to sit at a table where there are already only
girls (if the girls are willing), but it is not correct
for a girl to sit at a table where there are already
only men (however willing the men may be).
In these mixed groups each person pays for
his or her own lunch. It is not even necessary
for the man, or the men, as the case
may be, to offer to do so, and it is a distinct
breach of the rules of etiquette for a girl to allow
a man to pay for her lunch under such circumstances.</p>

<p>The only time when it is correct for a man and
a girl who are associated together in business to
have lunch, with him the host and her the guest,
is when the engagement is made ahead of time
as for any other social affair. On such an occasion
he should be as attentive as he would
in any other circumstances, taking care of
her wraps and placing her chair if the waiter is
not at hand to do it, suggesting dishes he thinks
perhaps she will like, and making himself as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
generally useful and agreeable as it is possible
for him to be. A point about which considerable
breath is wasted is whether a man should enter a
restaurant with the girl following or whether
he should allow her to lead the way. It makes
no material difference one way or the other, but
usually he permits her to go ahead and follows
closely enough behind to open the doors for her
and to receive whatever instructions the head
waiter has to offer.</p>

<p>If a man should enter a restaurant and find a
girl whom he knows already seated he may join
her if he thinks he will be not unwelcome, but
this does not make it incumbent upon him to pay
for her lunch. He may offer to do it, but it is
a matter that rests with the girl. If she does
not care to develop his acquaintance she should
not permit it, but if the two are good friends or
if she feels that he is a man she would like to
know, she may give him her check to settle along
with his own. A girl is herself the best judge
of what to do under such conditions, and if common
sense does not show her the way out etiquette
will not help.</p>

<p>Women in business sometimes bring up perplexing
questions and create awkward situations.
Suppose a man has asked a girl several times to
a business-social lunch and she has accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
every time. It seems that she should, as a man
would in the same position, make some return.
If she works for a house where there is a dining
room in which checks do not have to be settled at
the end of every meal she may do so without the
slightest difficulty, but if she is compelled to
take him to a place where the check must be
given to the waiter or paid at the desk before
they leave, she must look out for a different
way of managing things. Business luncheons
are usually paid for by the firm in whose
interests they are brought about, and if the
girl works for an organization where there
are several men employed she may ask one
of them to take her friend out to lunch. Then,
even if she is not present, her social duty is
done. The easiest way out of such a predicament,
it is superfluous to say, is never to get
into it.</p>

<p>A girl who enters business presumably accepts
the same conditions that men have to
meet. She has no right to expect special favors
because she is a woman. She does get a certain
amount of consideration, as indeed she should,
but she is very foolish and childish if she feels
resentful when a busy man fails to hold open a
door for her to pass through, when he rushes into
his office ahead of her, or when he cuts short an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
interview when she has said only half of what she
had on her mind.</p>

<p>Much is said about the man who keeps his
seat on a train while a woman stands. His defense
rests upon two arguments, first, that his
need is greater than hers (which is not true)
and, second, that she does not appreciate it even
when he does give it to her (which is not true
either). Unfortunately, there are as many rude
women in the world&mdash;and this statement is not
made carelessly&mdash;as there are rude men, and in
almost half the cases where a man rises to give
a woman his place the woman sits down without
even a glance toward her benefactor, as if the
act, which is no small sacrifice on the part of a
tired man, were not worth noticing. Every act
of civility or thoughtfulness should be rewarded
with at least a &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; and a good hearty
one at that.</p>

<p>Old people, cripples, and invalids rarely fail
to secure seats, however crowded a car may be.
A man seldom offers his place to another man
unless it is evident that the other, because of age,
infirmity, or extreme fatigue is greatly in need
of it. Well-bred girls resign their seats to
old men, but if they refuse to accept, the
girls do not insist. At a reunion of Confederate
veterans several years ago a girl rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
from her place on a street car to allow a feeble
old man to sit down. He gripped the strap
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't dead yet,&rdquo; he responded sturdily.</p>

<p>One of the chief petty complaints brought
against women is that they do not keep their
places in line. Some of them appear to have
neither conscience nor compunction about dashing
up to a ticket window ahead of twenty or
thirty people who are waiting for their turn.
Men would do the same thing (so men themselves
say) but they know very well that the
other men in the line would make them regret
it in short order. Two or three minutes is all
one can save by such methods and it is not worth
it. Even if it were more it would still not be
worth it.</p>

<p>When a woman breaks into a line it is quite
permissible for the person behind her (whoever
he or she may be) to say, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I
was here first.&rdquo; This should be enough. Sometimes
there is an almost desperate reason why
one should get to a window. Many times everybody
in the line has the same desperate reason
for being in a hurry, but now and then in individual
cases it is allowable for a woman (or a
man) to ask for another person's place. <i>But
only if there is a most urgent reason for it.</i> Much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
of courtesy is made up of petty sacrifices, and
most of the great sacrifices are only a larger
form of courtesy. It all comes back to Sir
Philip Sidney's principle of &ldquo;Thy need is greater
than mine,&rdquo; but it is only extraordinary circumstances
which warrant one's saying, &ldquo;My need
is greater than thine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since the beginning of time, and before (if
there was any before) women have done their
share of the work of the world. Formerly their
part of it centered in the home but now that machinery
has taken it out of the home they have
come out of the home too, to stand in the fields
and factories of industry by the side of their
fathers and husbands and brothers. Because
they have recently been thrown into closer association
in their hours of work than ever before
there has sprung up a certain amount of strife
between men and women, and a great deal is
said about how superior men are to women and
how superior women are to men. It is pure
nonsense. If all the men in the world were put
on one side of a scale and all the women on the
other, the scale would probably stand perfectly
still.</p>

<p>The woman in business should never forget
that she is a woman but she must remember that
above all things she is a citizen, and that she her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>self
has value and her work has value only as
they contribute to her community and her community
as it contributes to her country. Courtesy
is one of her strongest allies, this quality
which, alone, can do nothing, but, united to the
solid virtues that make character, can move
mountains.</p>

<p>We have said a good deal as we came along
about courtesy toward oneself and other people,
but perhaps the most valuable of all courtesies
in business is politeness toward one's job. It
is desirable for every woman to be pretty, well-dressed,
and well-groomed, but it is much more
desirable for the woman in business to be able
to do capable and efficient work. She may be
ornamental but she must be useful, and while
she is at the office her chief concern should be
with her job and not with herself. The end of
business is accomplishment, and courtesy is valuable
because it is a means of making accomplishment
easy and pleasant. It is this that gives
us the grace to accept whatever comes, if not
gladly, at least bravely.</p>

<p>It is a poor workman who quarrels with his
tools (or with his job), so the proverb says, and
there are two lines of Mr. Kipling's that might
be added. He was speaking of a king, but in
a democracy we are all kings:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wisest thing, we suppose, that a king can do for his land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the work that lies under his nose, with the tools that lie under his hand.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the lines are just as true when &ldquo;girl&rdquo; is
substituted for &ldquo;king&rdquo; and the pronouns are
changed accordingly.</p>
